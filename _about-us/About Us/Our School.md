<p><strong>A warm welcome to West View Primary School!</strong>

<p>As we embark on a new school year, I am filled with gratitude for our
West View Family. Our shared vision of developing every pupil into passionate
learners and confident leaders continues to be the heartbeat of our school.
Throughout the upcoming year, we are excited to provide vibrant programs
and enriching learning experiences that will shape your childâ€™s journey
in education.</p>
<p>In 2024, our school is set to unfold a tapestry of opportunities for growth,
exploration, and discovery. From our enriched VIEWAN XP curriculum to exciting
STRIVE modular and core co-curricular activities, we are dedicated to cultivating
an environment where each pupil can honour their strengths and unlock new
possibilities. To our new Primary 1 parents, a warm welcome! You will find
that we are committed to making the school a safe and happy place for all
pupils.</p>
<p>At West View Primary School, we believe in fostering a vibrant learning
community where our staff and pupils continually strive for excellence.
Our success is deeply rooted in the strong partnership we share with parents.
As we navigate the challenges and triumphs of the year, we look forward
to working alongside you to bring out the best in your child.</p>
