West View Primary School began functioning on 2 January 1998 to meet the increased demands for places in Bukit Panjang and Chua Chu Kang housing estates, as a result of rapid demographic population shifts. The school was housed in the former Jalan Teck Whye Primary School and Bukit Panjang Malay School buildings with very limited facilities. In December 1999, the school moved to its current premises at 31 Senja Road. Memorable that year was that the pupil population had increased so exponentially that four of its classes had to be located at the school’s second campus at Fajar Secondary School. The pupil population has since stabilised to its current state of 30 classes.

Significantly in 2015, the school underwent PERI upgrading to enhance its infrastructure and facilities to provide its pupils with a vibrant and conducive learning environment that better supports their holistic development. The new facilities include an Indoor Sports Hall, a covered basketball court, CCA rooms, dance studio and band room, Outdoor Learning Experiential areas, playground and jogging path. With these enhancements, the school started operating in a single-session in 2016 and started its Student Care Centre (SCC) to provide after-school care.  

  

Noteworthy of its SCC is that the operator is a joint-partnership of MOE and four Self-Help Groups (SHGs), namely Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Eurasian Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and Yayasan MENDAKI (MENDAKI), to tap on the community resources of the four SHGs to better support the holistic development of our pupils, especially those from less-privileged background.

  

Another milestone is that MOE Kindergarten (MK)@West View will commence its operation in 2021 to provide quality and affordable preschool education for Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2) children aged 5 and 6 and a full-day child care programme, Kindergarten Care (KCare).

  

In line with national imperatives and MOE priorities and focus, the school’s instructional programme has evolved to educate pupils for the future. The school’s operating tagline is _The Future of the World is in My School Today_!
