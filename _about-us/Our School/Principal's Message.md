<p><strong>A warm welcome to West View Primary School!</strong>
</p>
<p>Happy New Year and a heartfelt welcome to 2025! To our Primary 2 to Primary
6 pupils and parents, it is wonderful to have you back with us. To our
new Primary 1 pupils, we are thrilled to welcome you to the West View family.
Starting primary school is a special milestone, and we look forward to
journey alongside you as your child starts their journey with us.</p>
<p>This year, we are proud to share our refreshed vision, mission, and values
that reflect who we are and what we stand for as a school:</p>
<p>Vision: Every West Viewan a Passionate Learner and Confident Leader</p>
<p>Mission: To make school inviting and learning inspiring for our learners
to grow holistically</p>
<p>Values: Everyone’s a TALENT: Trustworthy, Active in Learning, Empathetic,
eNterprising, and Tenacious</p>
<p>Our TALENT values represent the heartbeat of everything we do. They remind
us that every child is unique, with their own talents waiting to be discovered
and nurtured. As we focus on growing their character, curiosity, and resilience,
we hope to inspire your child to embrace challenges, take initiative, and
strive for excellence—all while learning to care for others and contribute
meaningfully to the world around them.</p>
<p>Building strong bonds between home and school is key to helping every
child flourish. As we align with the Ministry of Education’s recent guidelines
on home-school partnership, we remain committed to open communication and
mutual respect in our partnership with you. Let us continue to show respectful
communication, positive role-modelling and real connections with our children
to help them learn and grow.</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing to be part of the West View journey. Together,
we will make school inviting and learning inspiring for your child. Let’s
make this year a meaningful and memorable one!</p>
