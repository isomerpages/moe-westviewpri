<p><strong>Warmest Greetings and Welcome to 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>Happy New Year and a warm welcome to 2026! To our Primary 2 to Primary
6 pupils and parents, it is wonderful to have you back with us. To our
new Primary 1 pupils and families, we are delighted to welcome you into
the West View family. Starting primary school is a significant milestone,
and we are honoured to partner you in this journey of growth, discovery,
and joy for your child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At West View, our vision of nurturing <strong>Passionate Learners and Confident Leaders</strong> is
brought to life through purposeful and well-designed experiences that help
every child discover their strengths and grow with joy. To develop <strong>passionate learners</strong>,
we anchor our curriculum in authentic learning. Our signature programme, <strong>VIEWAN XP</strong>,
enables pupils to apply <strong>Design Thinking</strong> to solve real-world
problems within their school and community. Through exploring issues, empathising
with users, prototyping ideas, and presenting solutions, pupils learn to
be curious, resourceful and reflective — key dispositions of future-ready
learners.</p>
<p>To develop <strong>confident leaders</strong>, the school provides multiple
platforms for pupils to grow in voice, choice and agency. Our <strong>STRIVE Modular CCA programme</strong> allows
pupils to explore diverse interests across sports, aesthetics and technology,
helping them build skills progressively while gaining confidence through
hands-on participation. Additionally, our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (ACES of West View)</strong> strengthens
pupils’ character and leadership through the arts and creative expression.
Whether in music, visual arts or performance, pupils learn to communicate
confidently, collaborate with peers, and express themselves purposefully.
Through these programmes, we aim to ensure that every West Viewan grows
holistically and use their TALENTS to contribute to the broader community.</p>
<p>This year, we continue to uphold our refreshed vision, mission and TALENT
values, which guide every aspect of teaching and learning in West View.
Beyond nurturing our pupils to be <strong>Trustworthy, Active in Learning, Empathetic, eNterprising and Tenacious</strong>,
we believe strongly that a child thrives best when the adults around them
work together with trust and shared purpose. The partnership between home
and school is therefore essential. When parents and teachers trust one
another, communicate respectfully, and uphold common expectations, our
children feel secure, supported and ready to learn. Likewise, when parents
invest time to build warm, open relationships with their children, it strengthens
their confidence to share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgement.</p>
<p>In line with <strong>Grow Well SG</strong>, we encourage all families to
prioritise your child’s overall well-being by helping them <strong>eat well, sleep well and bond well</strong>.
A balanced diet, consistent sleep routines and meaningful bonding at home
greatly influence your child’s attention, learning stamina and emotional
health. We also strongly encourage parents to be intentional about setting
healthy boundaries for screen time. Reducing non-essential device use helps
children stay focused and rested. It also creates more opportunities for
genuine conversations—moments where children feel safe to express themselves,
ask questions and build trust with the important adults in their lives.</p>
<p>As we begin 2026 together, let us continue to partner closely to make
school inviting and learning inspiring for every child. With your support
at home and our efforts in school, we can help every West Viewan grow to
be passionate learners and confident leaders.</p>
<p>Here’s wishing everyone an enriching and meaningful 2026!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Eugene Lee</strong> 
<br>Principal</p>
