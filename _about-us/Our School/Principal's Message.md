**A warm welcome to West View Primary School!**  

As we embark on a new school year, I am filled with gratitude for our West View Family. Our shared vision of developing every pupil into passionate learners and confident leaders continues to be the heartbeat of our school. Throughout the upcoming year, we are excited to provide vibrant programs and enriching learning experiences that will shape your child’s journey in education.

In 2024, our school is set to unfold a tapestry of opportunities for growth, exploration, and discovery. From our enriched VIEWAN XP curriculum to exciting STRIVE modular and core co-curricular activities, we are dedicated to cultivating an environment where each pupil can honour their strengths and unlock new possibilities. To our new Primary 1 parents, a warm welcome! You will find that we are committed to making the school a safe and happy place for all pupils.

At West View Primary School, we believe in fostering a vibrant learning community where our staff and pupils continually strive for excellence. Our success is deeply rooted in the strong partnership we
share with parents. As we navigate the challenges and triumphs of the year, we look forward to working alongside you to bring out the best in your child. 

Thank you for your unwavering support, and here's to another year of vibrant learning experiences!
