**A warm welcome to West View Primary School!**  

At West View Primary School (WVPS), we believe that every child has unique strengths and talents. Based on our ICARE values and PRIDE learning dispositions, we provide a vibrant learning environment to prepare our pupils to be passionate learners and confident leaders.

We have curated a distinctive West Viewan experience for our pupils. Our Applied Learning Programme, FRIEND of Earth, aims to develop each child to be eco-stewards of tomorrow. Our Learn for Life Programme, ACE the Arts, provides platforms for every child to gain exposure in the arts. Viewan XP, our signature interdisciplinary programme, prepares our pupils to be global citizens and future-ready learners. These programmes, together with our other curricular and co-curricular activities, provide a holistic education for each pupil. I encourage you to explore our website and Facebook page to learn more about our pupils’ vibrant learning experiences.  

  

Our staff has been instrumental in developing the West Viewan experience. Our teachers are passionate about learning as they help our pupils discover their talents. Since joining the school late last year, I have felt a strong culture of care among staff and pupils. I would like to affirm my staff for their dedication in building a warm and enabling school environment. I would also like to extend my appreciation to Parents, School Advisory Committee and Alumni for your partnership in nurturing our pupils. I look forward to your continued support as we embark on a new year.  

  

On behalf of the school, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the outgoing Principal, Mr Eddie Foo, for bringing the school to greater heights in his tenure at WVPS. We wish him the very best in his next school leadership appointment.
