</div>
<p>The school crest depicts three closely growing flowering plants enclosed
in a pentagon.</p>
<p>The light blue background signifies the purity and innocence of children
while the black frame implies the discipline and self-directedness our
children will grow and develop over the years in in West View Primary School.</p>
<p>The five sides of the pentagon symbolise the continuous development of
the children morally, cognitively, physically, socially and aesthetically.</p>
<p>The flowering plants forming the letters ‘W’ and ‘V’ represent the zest,
exuberance and growth that pupils experience while in West View Primary
School and the closeness of the plants indicates the friendship and trust
among pupils, teachers and the school community.</p>
