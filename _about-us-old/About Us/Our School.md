<p>West View Primary School began functioning on 2 January 1998 to meet the
increased demands for places in&nbsp;Bukit Panjang and Chua Chu Kang housing
estates, as a result of rapid demographic population shifts. The school
was housed in the former Jalan Teck Whye Primary School and Bukit Panjang
Malay School buildings with very limited facilities. In December 1999,
the school moved to its current premises at 31 Senja Road. Memorable that
year was that the pupil population had increased so exponentially that
four of its classes had to be located at the school’s second campus at
Fajar Secondary School. The pupil population has since stabilised to its
current state of 30 classes.</p>

<p>Significantly in 2015, the school underwent PERI upgrading to enhance
its infrastructure and facilities to provide its pupils with a vibrant
and conducive learning environment that better supports their holistic
development. The new facilities include an Indoor Sports Hall, a covered
basketball court, CCA rooms, dance studio and band room, Outdoor Learning
Experiential areas, playground and jogging path. With these enhancements,
the school started operating in a single-session in 2016 and started its
Student Care Centre (SCC) to provide after-school care.</p>
<p>Noteworthy of its SCC is that the operator is a joint-partnership of MOE
and four Self-Help Groups (SHGs), namely Chinese Development Assistance
Council (CDAC), Eurasian Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development
Association (SINDA), and Yayasan MENDAKI (MENDAKI), to tap on the community
resources of the four SHGs to better support the holistic development of
our pupils, especially those from less-privileged background.</p>
<p>Another milestone is that MOE Kindergarten (MK)@West View will commence
its operation in 2021 to provide quality and affordable preschool education
for Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2) children aged 5 and 6 and
a full-day child care programme, Kindergarten Care (KCare).</p>
<p>In line with national imperatives and MOE priorities and focus, the school’s
instructional programme has evolved to educate pupils for the future. The
school’s operating tagline is&nbsp;<em>The Future of the World is in My School Today</em>!</p>

<p>Since its beginning, Visual Arts and Performing Arts are a major strength
of the school. Over the years, the aesthetics programme achieved acclaim
and acknowledgement for its quality. It sustained Achievement Award for
Aesthetics for the sixth time, before the removal of MOE’s Masterplan of
Awards. In 2013, the&nbsp;<strong><em>Music Explorations through Brass Band</em>&nbsp;Programme</strong>&nbsp;achieved

<p>In 2016,&nbsp;<em><a href="/uniquely-us/strive-modular-cca" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">STRIVE@WVPS</a></em>&nbsp;was
started as the school’s signature programme to enrich its pupils’ learning
beyond the confines of the classrooms and academic subjects. Pupils go
through a range of modular activities to arouse their curiosity, developing
in them the ability to deal with ambiguity and having the willingness to
try their hand at something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2017,&nbsp;<strong><em>ACE the Arts</em></strong>, another signature
programme, was endorsed as its&nbsp;<a href="/uniquely-us/llp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Learning for Life Programme</a>&nbsp;by MOE. Through
this comprehensive six-year programme, pupils are given ample exposure
and experience to appreciate the arts and discover their talents, to develop
their character, attitudes and values.</p>

<p>In 2018, the school was accorded the&nbsp;<a href="/uniquely-us/alp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Applied Learning Programme</a>&nbsp;on environmental
science by MOE. Known as&nbsp;<strong><em>FRIEND of Earth</em></strong>,
the programme serves to empower pupils with the knowledge, values and dispositions
