There was excitement in the air. The Bhangra dancers of West View Primary School were invited to perform for the annual Chinese New Year Dinner organised by Senja-Cashew Community Club on 20 February, 2016. The Bhangra dancers worked very hard for this day and put up a spectacular performance. The audience thoroughly enjoyed themselves, watching the pupils groove energetically to the music. In their attractive outfits, the pupils looked like colourful dancing lights. For the Bhangra dancers, it was a wonderful time of performing and bonding with their peers.
