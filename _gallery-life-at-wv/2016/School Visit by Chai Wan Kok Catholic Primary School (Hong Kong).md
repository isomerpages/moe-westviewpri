On 24 March, 26 pupils and 3 teachers from Chai Wan Kok Catholic Primary School (Hong Kong) came to West View Primary for a visit. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves as they attended an English lesson, discovered how a local school looks like and immersed themselves in the Arts at West View. The Performing Arts groups, namely the Band, Malay Dance, Bhangra Dance and Chinese Dance gave interesting performances while a pupil from Chai Wan Kok Catholic Primary School performed on the baby grand piano. It was a memorable experience for selected Westviewans who were buddies with our visitors from Hong Kong as they learnt how to interact and build new friendships; sharing about life in Singapore while they learnt more about Hong Kong from their new friends.
