On 11th July 2016, My First Skool and PAP Community Foundation (PCF) visited West View Primary School for our Kindergarten Immersion Programme. This programme provides the kindergarteners an opportunity to experience a typical day in West View Primary School. The kindergarteners joined the primary one pupils in their classroom lessons which included Shared Book Reading (SBA) and PAL music lesson. To allow the kindergarteners to have an authentic recess experience, they were also given a chance to buy their own food from our school canteen with the help of our primary one pupils. During our Hari Raya concert, the kindergarteners also participated in the singing and dancing session.

  

We hope the kindergarteners had an enjoyable and memorable experience at West View Primary School. Hope to see you next year!
