Start-It-Right 2016
===================

To kick start the school year 2016, the Student Development Team (SDT) initiated a school-wide Start-It-Right (SIR) programme for all levels to welcome our pupils back to school. A 3-week SIR Orientation programme was also planned for the P1s to shed their first day jitters. To involve parents in their child’s learning process, they were invited to attend school with their children on the first day.

  

It was a 2-day SIR orientation programme for the P2 to P6 pupils. Fun and meaningful activities planned had helped pupils to bond well with their teachers and friends. Through the assembly talks and skits organised, pupils learnt and understood the school’s expectations and the traits of desirable behaviour. This year, West View pupils were introduced to the principles of the Leader in Me - 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by FranklinCovey. Pupils learn how to develop their potential through the practice of these habits.

P1 Shared Experience
--------------------

During the first three weeks of school, the P1 pupils went through a shared experience programme. Through this programme, they had a chance to interact and bond with different pupils and teachers in their level. Fun-filled and meaningful activities were also planned to provide pupils with learning experiences where they interact with one another to express their needs and emotions, learn how and where to obtain help and how to move around safely in school. This provided the pupils with an opportunity to familiarise themselves to West View so that they feel safe and happy. The programme also equipped pupils with knowledge of appropriate behaviour, routines, cooperative and communication skills so that they would be ready for productive learning throughout the rest of their learning journey at West View.
