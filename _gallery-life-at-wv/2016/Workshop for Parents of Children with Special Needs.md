HEARTS support group was set up in 2012 to better support parents of children with Special Educational Needs and to help build their network for a better support system for their child. Every year, workshops will be organized and tailored to the needs of the parents and we have invited parents in our neighbouring schools to join us. This year, we extended our invitation to the Bukit Panjang Support Group â€“ UNIQUE. It is a support group set up by parents for parents. The focus of the session was on setting realistic expectations and strategies for managing difficult behaviours. During the 3 hour workshop, parents were broken up into groups to note down questions or misconceptions that their child has received.
