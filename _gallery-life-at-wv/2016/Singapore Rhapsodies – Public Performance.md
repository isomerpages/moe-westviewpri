On 15 April, selected Westviewans put up performances at the National Gallery of Singapore. Some privileged pupils were given the opportunity to play on the one and only red Steinway piano in Singapore. This was the very same piano played by the famous pianist Lang Lang during the Sing 50 concert in 2015. It was a memorable experience for the performers and supporters as it was a concert, put up solely by Westviewans. Our talented Westviewans sang, performed on various instruments and experienced what were a tech run, a rehearsal and a public concert. The pupils also learn both concert and performance etiquette. After the concert, the pupils continued to be immersed in the Arts as they toured the Gallery and deepened their understanding of certain pieces of Art. It was indeed an extremely cultural and artistic afternoon!
