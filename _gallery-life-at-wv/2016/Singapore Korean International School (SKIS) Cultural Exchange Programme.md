A group of 21 pupils (Primary 6) participated in a Cultural Exchange Programme which was planned in collaboration with the Singapore Korean International School (SKIS). This programme aims at promoting cultural awareness among the pupils from diverse cultural background with specific focus on understanding the Korean and Indian cultures.

  

This two-day long programme was filled with lots of fun cultural games and activities. The Korean pupils participated in activities such as Henna Drawing, Murukku Making and Tiger and Goat Game (Indian traditional game) and watched the wonderful Deepavali Concert organised by the Tamil Department.

Our pupils went over to SKIS and played some Korean cultural games and had the opportunity to make and taste their local delicacy – Rice Cake (Songpyeon)! Yummy!

  

It was indeed an enriching experience for both our students and teachers!
