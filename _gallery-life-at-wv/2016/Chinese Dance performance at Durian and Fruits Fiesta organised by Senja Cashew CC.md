The Chinese Dance pupils were very excited when they were invited to perform for the Durian and Fruits Fiesta organised by Senja-Cashew Community Club. The pupils worked hard during practices. On 13 August 2016, the pupils put their hearts in and wowed the audience with a wonderful performance. They have indeed done the school proud.
