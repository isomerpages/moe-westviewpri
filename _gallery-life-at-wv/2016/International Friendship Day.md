West Viewans commemorated International Friendship Day in the week of 4thÂ April 2016. Pupils were exposed to the spices from different countries around the world, particularly in the region. This enables the pupils to see how such collaboration in the past has brought about partnership even in the present years. Pupils were asked to reflect on how they build friendships with those who are different from them.
