Fire, a symbol of passion and determination, burned bright in West View Primary as we celebrated our nation’s birthday with fun and games. Guests and pupils were welcomed by vibrant dancing tubes in the 5 Olympic colours. After the observance ceremony and the reading of the National Day message, the day’s main highlight began with the lighting of the Olympic torch by Mr Foo, Mr Quek and Mdm Kum. As the air horn sounded, all pupils rushed to the various stations, manned by our very own teachers, to participate in an array of fun carnival games, all in hopes of clinching the gold medal at the end of the day.

The classroom games were related to the Olympics theme, spreading the message of sportsmanship and excellence. The lower primary pupils were engaged in tele-match games in the hall. The P6s pupils even displayed great teamwork when competing with parents and teachers in Captains Ball! Great job!

  

At the same time, a dunk tank was set up to dunk the teachers! Pupils donated generously and were given the opportunity to dunk their teachers in the freezing cold water. Tons of fun for a good cause!

Before the cauldron fire was put off, various aesthetics activities were carried out in the classroom. P3 and P4 pupils had fun creating RIO2016 mascots using recycled materials while the P5 pupils were exposed to musical instruments from Brazil. They even had the opportunity to make their own musical instruments! The best mascots were paraded in the hall as part of the closing ceremony. It truly was a memorable and exciting day.
