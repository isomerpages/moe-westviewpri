West Viewans have participated in the first spring cleaning event of the year, ‘Clean WV’, on 25 May very enthusiastically. The pupils seized the opportunity to display Habit 6 – Together is Better as they showed how they were able to work together in being responsible towards the school environment.

  

This year, pupils started working together weeks before the actual event as they discussed how the cleaning process should take place. As a result, we saw many pupils coming to school prepared with rags, masks, pails, cleaning liquid among others.
