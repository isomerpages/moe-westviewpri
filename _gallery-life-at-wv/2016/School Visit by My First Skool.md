Mrs Aw Ai Ling, Deputy General Manager of My First Skool, together with seventeen personnel, visited West View on Friday, 22 April 2016. They were here to look at our learning environment and understand the primary school curriculum. Our guests were invited into our classrooms to have a go at the activities conducted under our signature programme, STRIVE@WVPS. The leaders from both organisations also shared their visions, beliefs and critical success factors towards excellence. Our guests also had a fruitful discussion with the school management team.

  

We hope the time was well-spent and we would visit each other again soon!
