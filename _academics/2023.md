# Friends of Singa
![](/images/Achievements/Academics/Friend%20of%20Singa%20Term%201%202023.jpg)
We are proud to present the certificate of participation to 5 pupils who took part in the Friends of Singa in Year 2022.

Our P2 to P6 pupils have written in during Term 4 Kindsville newsletter to show how they can show small acts of kindness to everyone around us. 

We appreciate the efforts of our pupils and hope they can continue to spread kindness around us.
