<p>Rakan Bahasa initiative is organised by the Malay Language Council. Pupils
selected to be Rakan Bahasa pupils will be given a set of mission / tasks
which revolve around skills such as reading, writing, speaking and other
activities that support Malay language learning. This will encourage students
who are passionate about the Malay language and culture, to spread the
love of the language to their peers, friends and families. Their role is
also to share the beauty of the Malay language &amp; to continue promoting
it.</p>
<p>Two students are appointed as Rakan Bahasa (Friends of the Language) by
the Malay Language Council, Singapore (Majlis Bahasa Melayu Singapura).</p>

<p>We would like to thank all pupils who have participate in the Voice of
West View. Today, we would like to present the top suggestion certificates
to the following pupils for their unique suggestion on how we can celebrate
Childrenâ€™s Day. It is very interesting that for this time round, the top
suggestion all came from the Primary 2. Perhaps they are the most creative
lot among us.</p>
