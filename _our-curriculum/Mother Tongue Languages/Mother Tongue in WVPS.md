_"Children are motivated to better themselves in a supportive and encouraging environment. Every child should have a taste of success and no achievement is too small to be mentioned. I believe teachers should be innovative in their teaching approaches and constantly hone their craft to excite pupils and better engage them in their learning. Through the use of Malay literature, I seek to ignite hope, develop confidence and help pupils to love Malay Language."_
