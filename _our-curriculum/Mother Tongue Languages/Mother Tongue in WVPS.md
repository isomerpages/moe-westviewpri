<br><strong>Mdm Sarifah Hassan</strong> 
<br><em>"Children are motivated to better themselves in a supportive and encouraging environment. Every child should have a taste of success and no achievement is too small to be mentioned. I believe teachers should be innovative in their teaching approaches and constantly hone their craft to excite pupils and better engage them in their learning. Through the use of Malay literature, I seek to ignite hope, develop confidence and help pupils to love Malay Language."</em>

<br>"营造有利于学习华文的环境，让学生通过各种游戏及活动学习华文，提升对学习华文的兴趣。 &nbsp;</p>
<p>我希望家庭语言背景各不相同的学生都能学会欣赏华族文化，视华文为有活力又有价值的语言，最终乐学华文、愿学华文，并在生活中善用华文。"</p>

<br><em>"Every child is an individual with their own learning style. To me, education is a lifelong journey, and I believe in instilling a love and appreciation for one's mother tongue language and culture through the joy of learning."</em>
