**Mother Tongue Curriculum**

  

In West View, the Mother Tongue Department aims to make the learning of Mother Tongue Language an enjoyable experience and encourage children to learn the language to the best of their ability. We believe in “保底不封顶“– we endeavor not to cap achievement at the top, but continue to strive to lift the bottom.

  

By the end of Primary 6 at WVPS, pupils should be able to:

*   Be competent in listening, speaking, reading, writing & interacting with one another in their Mother Tongue Language
*   Achieve a deeper knowledge of their own Mother Tongue culture and values

  

**Engaging Learning Experience**

  

Our Mother Tongue lessons use differentiated instructions and activities to cater to the different needs of our pupils who come from diverse language background. Our curriculum offers an experience to learners that not only helps them expand their knowledge, but also practise it in a way that they can retain it.

We use games and other interesting activities to promote interest and reinforce learning so that our Mother Tongue lessons are fun and engaging.
