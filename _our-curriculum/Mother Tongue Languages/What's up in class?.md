<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>In West View, the Mother Tongue Department aims to make the learning of
Mother Tongue Language an enjoyable experience and encourage children to
learn the language to the best of their ability. We believe in “保底不封顶“–
we endeavor not to cap achievement at the top, but continue to strive to
lift the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>By the end of Primary 6 at WVPS, pupils should be able to:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Be competent in listening, speaking, reading, writing &amp; interacting
with one another in their Mother Tongue Language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve a deeper knowledge of their own Mother Tongue culture and values</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engaging Learning Experience</strong>
<br>Our Mother Tongue lessons use differentiated instructions and activities
to cater to the different needs of our pupils who come from diverse language
background. Our curriculum offers an experience to learners that not only
helps them expand their knowledge, but also practise it in a way that they
can retain it.</p>
