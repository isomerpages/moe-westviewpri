<p>Our Mother Tongue department programmes focus on the learning process
through experience. Through experiential learning, we hope to influence
both feelings and emotions as well as enhance knowledge and skills. Learning
through reflecting develops pupils’ confidence in using Mother Tongue Language.</p>

<p><strong><u>P3 Mother Tongue Cultural Camp</u></strong>
<br>Singapore is rich in diversity, multilingual and multiracial. As a multicultural
country, the more we know about the culture of another Singaporean in another
community, the more we can draw ourselves closer. Our pupils will also
be able to have some grounding of ASEAN languages so that they can easily
pick up the languages should they need them for economic or other reasons
in their adult life.</p>
