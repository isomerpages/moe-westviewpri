**_Enriching the Learning Experiences_**

  

As the Chinese saying goes “学海无涯“， the sea of learning has no horizon. In West View, we aim to provide the opportunities for pupils so that enriching the learning experience sets no limit to what pupils can learn. We hope to instill in our pupils passion and promote an interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue Languages.
