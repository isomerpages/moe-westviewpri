**_Enriching the Learning Experiences_**

  

As the Chinese saying goes “学海无涯“， the sea of learning has no horizon. In West View, we aim to provide the opportunities for pupils so that enriching the learning experience sets no limit to what pupils can learn. We hope to instill in our pupils passion and promote an interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue Languages.

  

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Mother Tongue Culture Inculcation</strong></p>


We aim to develop in our pupils - a love for the language, and to understand and appreciate our MT cultures. At West View, we strive to engage our pupils in creative and exciting activities to support their desire to learn.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Conversational Chinese & Malay</strong></p>

Singapore is rich in diversity, multilingual and multiracial. As a multicultural country, the more we know about the culture of another Singaporean in another community, the more we can draw ourselves closer. Our pupils will also be able to have some grounding of ASEAN languages so that they can easily pick up the languages should they need them for economic or other reasons in their adult life.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Promote the love for the Mother Tongue Languages</strong></p>

At West View, we strive to stimulate our pupils' interest in learning by creating opportunities for pupils to use Mother Tongue Language. We hope that pupils will not only be able to cultivate self-motivated pursuit of knowledge, they can “learn by doing” and reflect on the experience.
