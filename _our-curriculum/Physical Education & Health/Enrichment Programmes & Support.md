<h2>Active Kids Programme (AKP)</h2>
<p>Through the Active Kids Programme (AKP), pupils acquire practical knowledge
and skills to make healthier food choices while actively participating
in games and sports. Facilitated by our PE teachers, AKP provides pupils
with hands-on, experiential learning opportunities that promote active
engagement, reinforce positive lifestyle habits, and encourage the development
of self-management and responsible decision-making skills.</p>

<h2>Health Log</h2>
<p>To encourage our pupils to adopt good healthy habits that they have learnt
during health education lessons, our school has introduced the health log.
It is a 21-Day Challenge where parents monitor their children to see if
they have adopted those healthy habits. Pupils are also clear about the
good habits they should have to keep themselves healthy.</p>
