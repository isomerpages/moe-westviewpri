<h2>Health and Wellness Week</h2>

healthy habits in our pupils. One of the highlights is the Health and Wellness
Week, in which pupils engage in fun activities related to nutrition, physical
activity and mental wellness.</p>

<h2>West View Steps Challenge</h2>
<p>In a bid to tackle the rising trend of a sedentary lifestyle where pupils
engage in online gaming and social media, West View Primary school partnered
with the Health Promotion Board by embarking on the Step tracker challenge
to encourage pupils to move more.</p>

<h2>Health Log</h2>
<p>To encourage our pupils to adopt good healthy habits that they have learnt
during health education lessons, our school has introduced the health log.
It is a 21-Day Challenge where parents monitor their children to see if
they have adopted those healthy habits. Pupils are also clear about the
good habits they should have to keep themselves healthy.</p>
