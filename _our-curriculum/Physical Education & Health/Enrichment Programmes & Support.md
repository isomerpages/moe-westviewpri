<h2>Active Kids Programme (AKP)</h2>

<h2>Health Log</h2>
<p>To encourage our pupils to adopt good healthy habits that they have learnt
during health education lessons, our school has introduced the health log.
It is a 21-Day Challenge where parents monitor their children to see if
they have adopted those healthy habits. Pupils are also clear about the
good habits they should have to keep themselves healthy.</p>
