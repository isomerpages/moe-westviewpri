<p>The PE Department seeks to inculcate the Olympic values of excellence,
respect, and friendship through KidsFest!. In odd-numbered years, West
View Primary School organises its Annual Sports Meet at Bukit Gombak Sports
Stadium, where pupils participate in a wide range of track-and-field events
and enjoy team-based telematches. In the lead-up to the event, pupils work
collaboratively within their classes to prepare for the various activities,
fostering teamwork and school spirit. In even-numbered years, pupils take
part in the Olympic Carnival, where they learn and experience the Olympic
values through participation in themed activities and interactive carnival
booths.</p>

<p>West View Primary School leverages a variety of platforms and programmes
to engage pupils in developing and sustaining healthy habits. One key initiative
is the Health and Wellness Week, which provides pupils with meaningful
and age-appropriate learning experiences centred on nutrition, physical
activity, and mental well-being. Through a range of interactive activities
such as hands-on workshops, movement-based challenges, and reflective discussions,
pupils learn to make informed lifestyle choices and practise positive self-care
habits. These experiences help pupils develop greater awareness of their
physical and mental health, reinforcing the importance of balance and well-being
as part of a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>
<h2>West View Health Challenge</h2>
<p>In response to the growing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles, where pupils
spend extended periods engaged in online gaming and social media, West
View Primary School introduced the Health Challenge Programme to promote
the sustained adoption of healthy habits. The programme encourages pupils
to integrate regular physical activity and positive lifestyle practices
into their daily routines through step tracking and the setting of personal
and class-based goals. Through consistent participation, pupils develop
self-management, perseverance, and a sense of ownership over their health
and well-being. By embedding physical activity into their everyday lives,
the Health Challenge Programme nurtures positive dispositions towards active
living and reinforces the importance of making informed and healthy lifestyle
choices beyond the school environment.</p>
<h2>Fruittie Veggie Programme</h2>
<p>The programme encourages students to eat more fruits and vegetables, to
drink mineral water instead of sugary drinks and to buy healthy snacks
during recess. Pupils receives a token which they can deposit in the “West
View Bank of PRIDE”. The classes with the most token win prizes.</p>

<p>Our Dancercise workout sessions promote the importance of active living
among pupils. These high-energy sessions not only help pupils start the
day feeling invigorated but also spark their enthusiasm for movement. Through
learning novel and engaging dance routines, pupils develop coordination,
confidence, and a sense of enjoyment in staying active.</p>
