<h2>Olympism@WVPS</h2>
<p>The PE department aims to inculcate the Olympic values of excellence,
respect and friendship through Olympic Day. In 2019, West View Primary
School organised our inaugural Olympic Day at Bukit Gombak Sports Stadium.
The pupils participated in a myriad of athletic events and had fun in the
Telematches. Leading up to this event, our pupils worked together as a
class to prepare for the events. In the same year, our junior sports CCA
members also visited the Singapore Sports Museum at Sports Hub as part
of our Olympism@WVPS.</p>
<h2>Healthy Canteen</h2>
<p>Besides exercising, our school strives to create greater awareness of
different aspects of health through the use of learning spaces. The school
canteen was given a new facelift with learning walls to remind pupils on
how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Also, set meals incorporating food from the four main food groups - brown
rice and wholemeal bread, meat and others, vegetables and fruit – are also
introduced. This is to help ensure that pupils receive the right nutrients
necessary for their growing needs.</p>
<p>As many dietary preferences are inculcated from young, it is important
to shape these early in life and empower children to make healthier choices
throughout life.</p>
<h2>Fruittie Veggie Programme</h2>
<p>The programme encourages students to eat more fruits and vegetables, to
drink mineral water instead of sugary drinks and to buy healthy snacks
during recess. Pupils receives a token which they can deposit in the “West
View Bank of PRIDE”. The classes with the most token win prizes.</p>
