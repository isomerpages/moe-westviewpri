Our PE curriculum provides a range of movement experiences to develop pupils holistically. Fundamental motor skills and core values provide a strong foundation for the learning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities and sports. Pupils build confidence by being more efficient, effective and versatile in their movements. This would help them develop a strong foundation in motor skills and enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.  

  

Our PE curriculum comprises 7 broad learning areas:

Sports and Games
----------------

Pupils experience a range of game play such as territorial-invasion, net-barrier, striking-fielding, and other games. These experiences enhance pupils’ developing skills and understanding of the game.
