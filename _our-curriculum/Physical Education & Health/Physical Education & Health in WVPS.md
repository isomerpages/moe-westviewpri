_"I believe that high-quality PE and CCA Programmes enable pupils to develop a wide range of soft skills and values, which is critical to help them achieve success in life. I envisage pupils of West View Primary to be active individuals who adopt healthy lifestyle, passionate in what they pursue and confident in leading others."_

**Mr Ramesh Ramiya** <br>
<em>"I have been teaching for 25 years. My passion for sports has given me the impetus to spread this love to the younger generation.<br><br>
I subscribe to a simple teaching philosophy.&nbsp; I believe that all students should have the opportunity to enjoy sports. I take pride in teaching and I do my best always. I ensure that I inject passion and energy into all my lessons.<br><br>
I have had the privilege of teaching various age groups, and I am thankful that I have now been given the opportunity to teach West Viewans to embrace sports, thereby making it part of their lives. Through sports, I hope to cultivate their leadership and collaborative skills."</em>
