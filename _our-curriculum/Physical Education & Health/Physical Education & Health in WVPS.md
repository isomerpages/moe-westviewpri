<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>A Westviewan is an active sportsperson, physically competent and leading
a healthy lifestyle</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong> 
<br>To deliver quality and enjoyable PE lessons, anchored with values</p>
<p><strong>Message from HOD Physical Education &amp; Co-Curricular Activities</strong> 
<br><strong>Mr Tan Leng Khoon</strong> 
<br><em>“I firmly believe that well-structured Physical Education (PE) and co-curricular programmes play a vital role in nurturing students’ soft skills and core values. These attributes are essential in preparing them for success beyond the classroom. I envision the students of West View Primary as active and health-conscious individuals who embrace a healthy lifestyle, pursue their interests with passion, and demonstrate the confidence to lead and inspire others.”</em>

<p><strong>Curriculum Framework &amp; Description<br></strong>Our Physical
Education curriculum provides purposeful and progressive movement experiences
that support the holistic development of our students. Anchored in the
development of fundamental motor skills and school values and emerging
21<sup>st</sup> century competencies such as collaboration, communication
and adaptiveness, the curriculum lays a strong foundation for active participation
and enjoyment in physical activities and sports. As pupils refine their
movement skills through structured learning experiences, they develop confidence,
adaptability, and self-management. This progression not only enhances their
physical competence but also cultivates positive dispositions towards lifelong
participation in physical activity and healthy living.</p>
