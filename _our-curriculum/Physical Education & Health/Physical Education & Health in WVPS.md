<p><strong>Message from HOD Physical Education &amp; Co-Curricular Activities</strong> 
<br><strong>Mr Tan Leng Khoon</strong> 
<br><em>“I firmly believe that well-structured Physical Education (PE) and Co-curriculum are essential in helping students cultivate a diverse range of soft skills and core values. These qualities are pivotal for their success in life. I envision the students of West View Primary as active, health-conscious individuals, who not only embrace a healthy lifestyle but are also passionate about their pursuits and confident in their ability to lead and inspire others.”</em>
