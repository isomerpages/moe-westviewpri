<p><strong>Student Leadership Development</strong>
</p>
<p>In West View, we aim to develop student leadership across all student
segments to instil in pupils a heart to serve others and courage to initiate
a positive change in the school and wider communities, in support of our
school vision "Every West Viewan a confident leader". This is achieved
through deliberate and structured instruction, curated experiences and
reflective practices.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts the Leadership Challenge Framework (by James Kouzes
and Barry Posner) to develop leadership competencies in pupils. It acknowledges
that leadership is not about personality, power or privilege but about
behaviour. In taking charge of their teams to achieve a shared goal, our
leaders engage in The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership: Model the
Way, Inspire a Shared, Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to
Act and Encourage the Heart.</p>
<p>Student leadership development in West View is anchored by the following
key beliefs:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every pupil can be developed as a leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every pupil should be developed as a leader.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Student leadership development needs to be intentional</p>
