**<u>WV Leaders</u>**

  

Every West Viewan is a leader - first to self and then to others. The pupils are taught to have a positive attitude and be a positive influence to others. This knowledge is translated into actions when various opportunities are created for them.

  

When West Viewans get the chance to lead their classmates and CCA-mates, we view our role as one to develop the pupilsâ€™ confidence to guide their peers and insti the dare in them to step out of their comfort zone.

  

At the pinnacle, there are the West View Prefects. As a prefectorial board, we strive to serve beyond ourselves in creating a positive experience for all. As an opportunity for the prefects to have a deep understanding of their specialised roles and responsibilities, they are divided into three niche areas - Diplomats, Safety Squad and Environment Corp. Each niche area is important yet, together, they form an invincible force.
