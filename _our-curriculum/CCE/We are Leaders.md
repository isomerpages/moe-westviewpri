<p><strong><u>WV Leaders</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Every West Viewan is a leader - first to self and then to others. The
pupils are taught to have a positive attitude and be a positive influence
to others. This knowledge is translated into actions when various opportunities
are created for them.</p>
<p>When West Viewans get the chance to lead their classmates and CCA-mates,
we view our role as one to develop the pupilsâ€™ confidence to guide their
peers and insti the dare in them to step out of their comfort zone.</p>
<p>At the pinnacle, there are the West View Prefects. As a prefectorial board,
we strive to serve beyond ourselves in creating a positive experience for
all. As an opportunity for the prefects to have a deep understanding of
their specialised roles and responsibilities, they are divided into three
niche areas - Diplomats, Safety Squad and Environment Corp. Each niche
area is important yet, together, they form an invincible force.</p>
