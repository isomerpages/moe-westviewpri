<p><u>Adaptation of Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits</u>
</p>
<p>As West Viewans become confident leaders, they learn and practise these
7 habits regularly. These habits are also emphasised on in various lessons
and during the weekly Start-It-Right programme, West View’s weekly pre-assembly
sessions.</p>

<p><u>Experience + Reflection</u>
</p>
<p>West Viewans are encouraged to reflect on the rich experience they have.
According to Kolb’s Learning Cycle, when pupils think about what they have
experienced, they create meaning of it. This interpretation that the pupils
have can then be transferred to other aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>With this process, West Viewans do not just focus on what they are doing.
Instead, they reflect on what they can learn from the activities or programmes
so that the learning can be applied in future.</p>
