<h2>CCE Curriculum</h2>
<p><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE (FTGP) lessons are taught by all Form Teachers. There is emphasis
on explicit teaching of social emotional competencies in CCE (FTGP) as
the basic skills taught at the Primary levels lay the foundation for more
complex conversations and discussions at the Secondary levels and beyond.
Topics related to developing citizenship dispositions are also taught in
CCE (FTGP) to foster inter-ethnic understanding and appreciation for one
anotherâ€™s culture in a multicultural classroom setting.</p>

<p><strong><br>CCE Mother Tongue Language - CCE (MTL)</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE lessons are taught in Mother Tongue languages (MTL). For students
who take the non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL) as their Mother Tongue and
for those exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English. CCE
MT teachers use cultural stories, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to
each Mother Tongue Language to teach moral values and perspective taking.</p>
