<p><strong>2. Values in Education (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) at West View empowers pupils to become active,
responsible citizens through hands-on experiences. These experiences are
designed to enable pupils to contribute meaningfully to the school as well
as broader community. The reflective thinking process in VIA not only deepens
their understanding of societal and environmental needs but also encourages
them to apply their values, knowledge, and skills in real-world contexts.</p>

<p><strong>3. Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>
</p>
<p>CW in CCE is important as it focuses on the well-being of our pupils as
they navigate cyberspace, equipping them with the knowledge and skills
to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive
presence in cyberspace, and be safe and responsible users of ICT. Through
Cyber Wellness talks, schoolwide programmes and recess activities, the
school aims to equip pupils with the knowledge, skills, and values to maintain
a positive presence in cyberspace and learn to become responsible digital
learners.</p>

<p><strong>4. &nbsp;Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps pupils develop a sense of purpose
in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong
learning, ECG helps our pupils to develop a growth mindset, adaptability
and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate
the value of all occupations.</p>
<p>Our P6 pupils experienced the movie-making process at Warner Brothers
Discovery office! The pupils learned about the journey of the content creators,
producers, animators and more that make up the media industry.</p>

<p><strong>5. Sexuality Education (Growing Years’ Series)</strong>
</p>
<p>Sexuality Education is about enabling pupils to understand the physiological,
social, and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite
sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
