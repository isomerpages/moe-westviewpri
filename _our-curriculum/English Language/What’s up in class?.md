While exploring the text and enquiring about the theme, West Viewans will acquire the metalanguage through a myriad of activities.</p><p>West Viewans are given varied opportunities in speaking and writing to apply the metalanguage learnt. They are also equipped with the correct learning dispositions, allowing them not to be just effective communicators but also affective ones.</p><p><strong><em>The librarian giving a tour of the school library to the Primary 1 pupils</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="The librarian giving a tour of the school library to the Primary 1 pupils" src="/images/The%20librarian%20giving%20a%20tour%20of%20the%20school%20library%20to%20the%20Primary%201%20pupils%20.png"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>Cultivating the habit of reading with SMM in place</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Cultivating the habit of reading with SMM in place" src="/images/Cultivating%20the%20habit%20of%20reading%20with%20SMM%20in%20place%20.png"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>Lower Primary pupils presenting during a shared experience</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Lower Primary pupils presenting during a shared experience" src="/images/Lower%20Primary%20pupils%20presenting%20during%20a%20shared%20experience.jpg"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>Pre-writing activity: Group work and hot seat activity to generate ideas for writing</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pre-writing activity: Group work and hot seat activity to generate ideas for writing" src="/images/Pre-writing%20activity%20Group%20work%20and%20hot%20seat%20activity%20to%20generate%20ideas%20for%20writing.jpg"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>Pupils learning new words through activities and games, thus enabling them to expand their vocabulary.</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pupils learning new words through activities and games, thus enabling them to expand their vocabulary." src="/images/Pupils%20learning%20new%20words%20through%20activities%20and%20games.jpeg"></div><p></p><p><strong><em>Pupils learning collaboratively through learning centre activities</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pupils learning collaboratively through learning centre activities" src="/images/Pupils%20learning%20collaboratively%20through%20learning%20centre%20activities.jpeg"></div><p><strong><u>Gr8 quiz</u></strong><br>Gr8 quiz or commonly known as Grammar Fluency is conducted in Primary 1 to Primary 6 classes a few times a week during English lessons. It is conducted as a reinforcement of grammar rules before a grammar lesson.</p><p>Using grammar quizzes allows pupils to revise and understand a particular grammar item before moving on to more complex grammatical structures. Pupils gain confidence and they are more familiar with the grammar rules too.</p><p><strong><em>Pupils being accustomed to the routine and being participative in class</em></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:90%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pupils being accustomed to the routine and being participative in class" src="/images/Pupils%20being%20accustomed%20to%20the%20routine%20and%20being%20participative%20in%20class.jpg"></div><p></p><h4>READ Programme</h4><p>During READ periods, P1 and P2 West Viewans will be actively engaged in reading graded books that allow them to inquire, relate and explore. These differentiated tasks in the READ booklets support the individual needs of the pupils where they explore a variety of graded books from different genres. After reading the text, they will be supported with different reading extension activities to provide them opportunities to show their understanding and practise their literacy skills.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 78%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/Read_prog_1.png"></div></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English/READ_prog_2.png"></div></th></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
