<p>The English Language curriculum aims to develop effective and affective
language use in our pupils through</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>listening, reading and viewing from print, non-print and digital networked
resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>speaking, writing and representing in standard English appropriate for
different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using English with impact, effect and affect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guided by CLLIPS as explained below, teachers will apply knowledge of
the disciplinarity of EL and guide their pupils effectively and confidently
towards a deeper understanding of the language and its use, and facilitate
the transfer of learning.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contextualisation - pupils learning the English language in authentic
and meaningful contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learner-centredness - teaching is differentiated according to pupils’
readiness, interests and learning profiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning-focused interaction - pupils working together actively to boost
their confidence in the use of the language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration - teaching of receptive skills, productive skills and metalanguage
by building on one another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process orientation - teacher models, scaffolds and differentiates the
learning of language skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spiral progression - teaching of the English Language will be at increasing
levels of difficulty and sophistication</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In West View, our pupils acquire the English Language through the exploration
of thematic texts. While exploring the text and enquiring about the theme,
West Viewans will acquire the metalanguage through a myriad of activities.</p>
<p>West Viewans are given varied opportunities in speaking and writing to
apply the metalanguage learnt. They are also equipped with the correct
learning dispositions, allowing them not to be just effective communicators
but also affective ones.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cultivating the habit of reading</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that fostering a love for reading from an early age is key
to developing lifelong learners. To nurture this passion, our Primary 1
and Primary 2 pupils enjoy scheduled weekly library visits, where they
explore a wide range of books. For Primary 3 to Primary 6, library visits
take place fortnightly, complemented by extensive reading sessions in class.
During these sessions, students have access to a diverse selection of fiction
and non-fiction books, encouraging them to discover new interests and broaden
their knowledge. Through these initiatives, we aim to cultivate a reading
culture that enhances language skills, creativity, and critical thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Gr8 quiz</strong>
</p>
<p>Gr8 quiz or commonly known as Grammar Fluency is conducted in Primary
1 to Primary 6 classes a few times a week during EL lessons. It is conducted
as a reinforcement of grammar rules before a grammar lesson.</p>
<p>Using grammar quizzes allows pupils to revise and understand a particular
grammar item before moving on to more complex grammatical structures. Pupils
gain confidence and they are more familiar with the grammar rules too.</p>

<p><strong>READ Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>During READ periods, P1 and P2 pupils will be actively engaged in reading
graded books that allow them to inquire, relate and explore. These differentiated
tasks in the READ booklets support the individual needs of the pupils where
they explore a variety of graded books from different genres. After reading
the text, they will be supported with different reading extension activities
to provide them opportunities to show their understanding and practise
their literacy skills.</p>

<p><strong><em>Learning Centres</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>The pupils’ skills in speaking, reading, writing and listening are reinforced through the different learning centre stations. The pupils are engaged and they get to learn language in a fun and interactive manner with the use of English Language activities and games. </em>
