<p><strong>Curriculum Framework &amp; Description</strong>
</p>
<p>English Language (EL) is the common language that facilitates bonding
among the different ethnic and cultural groups. On the global platform,
English Language allows Singaporeans to tap into a knowledge-based economy
where it is the main lingua franca of the Internet, of science and technology,
and of world trade.</p>
<p>The development of multiple competencies will enable our young to capitalise
on the rich opportunities of the digital age, while maintaining a strong
foundation in the language. It will allow our students to engage meaningfully
and confidently with the wider and more diverse communities both in and
out of Singapore.</p>

<p>The above diagram presents the key features of the EL Syllabus undergirded
by the principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS) and EL teaching
processes (ACOLADE). Drawing on the model of effective teaching in the
Singapore Teaching Practice, a pedagogical emphasis on Multiliteracies,
Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue in the EL classroom ensures
effective and affective language use for all EL learners. The approach
to language teaching and learning ensures a firm and rich foundation for
all.</p>
