<h5><strong>Literacy Support Programmes</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Through specialised early intervention programmes, learning support is
provided for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils who need targeted help with
the English Language. These pupils are selected through careful screening.
The programme focuses on building English language skills that pupils used
to decode and be more confident users of the language.</p>
<p>LSP is conducted half an hour a day (in small groups of 8 to 10 pupils).</p>

<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong>
</p>
<p>RRP aims to provide additional support for P3 and P4 pupils who have difficulty
in reading. Pupils are exposed to a range of coping strategies for reading
comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in
the regular classroom.</p>
<p>RRP is conducted on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>kidsREAD</strong>
</p>
<p>kidsREAD is a nationwide reading programme which aims to promote the love
of reading and cultivate good reading habits among our lower primary pupils.</p>
<p>The programme offers a range of engaging activities designed to foster
a love for reading and enhance literacy skills in pupils. Key activities
include storytelling sessions with expressive narration, interactive discussions,
and themed crafts or role play that reinforce the books' concepts. Pupils
also engage in games, vocabulary-building exercises, and group interactions
to improve comprehension, social skills, and confidence. Through these
activities, the programme nurtures creativity, critical thinking, and a
lifelong love of reading.</p>
