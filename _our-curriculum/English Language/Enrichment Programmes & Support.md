Education Minister Ong Ye Kung mandated, “Lift the bottom, not cap the top”. In West View, we ensure that we have programmes to stretch the high progress learners and to support the struggling learners.


##### **Literacy Support Programmes**

**Learning Support Programme (LSP)**

Through specialised early intervention programmes, learning support is provided for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils who need targeted help with the English Language. These pupils are selected through careful screening. The programme focuses on building English language skills that pupils used to decode and be more confident users of the language.  

  

LSP is conducted half an hour a day (in small groups of 8 to 10 pupils).

**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)**

  

RRP aims to provide additional support for P3 and P4 pupils who have difficulty in reading. Pupils are exposed to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in the regular classroom.

  

RRP is conducted on Monday and Wednesday from 2 p.m. to 2.45 p.m.

  

  

**Enrichment Programme: DA VINCI - B.R.A.I.N. PROGRAMME**


BRAIN programme aims to get the high progress pupils to develop, organise and express their ideas coherently and use these skills to produce texts for a variety of purposes, audiences, and contexts.

  

Primary 4 pupils will learn to speak clearly and convey their ideas expressively. They will also improve their skills in articulation and vocal projection. They also get to think on their feet when given impromptu speech situations.

The Primary 5 pupils will be able to apply the skills taught in this BRAIN Programme to become descriptive writers. They will also learn the importance of being a creative and reflective communicator by infusing literacy devices to make various text types more interesting.
