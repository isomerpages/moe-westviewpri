What’s up in class?
-------------------

The PAL programme focuses on the development of socio-emotional competencies (SEL) in our pupils. Pupils learn how to show respect, develop responsible decision making skills, build confidence, be curious and creative, cooperate and work with others. These skills are essential for pupils to excel both academically and in life. These competencies are developed through the five domains - Music, Art, Drama, Outdoor Education, Sports and Games, Dance.

Music
-----

Pupils are given the opportunity to explore sounds in new and creative ways. They are challenged with a variety of musical tasks and work in groups to be innovative in their ideas and performances.

Drama
-----

Drama provides the contexts or the stories for students to explore, discuss and consider their own values and choices in a safe environment. Through the understanding of body language, expressions, emotions and social relationships, pupils work together to rehearse and present their role-play to others.

Outdoor Education
-----------------

Pupils learn through authentic situations in the outdoors such as finding their way around a garden in a small group. They gain awareness and appreciation of the inter-relationships between humans and the natural environment.
