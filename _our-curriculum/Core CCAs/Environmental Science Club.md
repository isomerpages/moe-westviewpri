<h1>Environmental Science Club</h1>
<h2>Brief of CCA</h2>
<p>The Environmental Science Club at West View Primary School is where young
environmental champions bloom! Open to passionate P3 to P6 pupils, the
club inspires our pupils to explore, learn and act on environmental issues
through engaging hands-on activities and meaningful advocacy projects.</p>
<p>Members of the club will cultivate lush edible gardens in our Blooming
Gardens, upcycle materials into creative works and embark on learning journeys
to deepen their understanding of sustainability. They will also earn various
Young Scientist Badges in this environmental stewardship journey.</p>
<p>Beyond the school grounds, our club aims to make an impact through outreach
activities, sharing green tips, and inspiring peers to embrace eco-friendly
habits. Through teamwork, exploration, and innovation, we hope that our
young environmentalists will grow into future-ready leaders who care for
our planet.</p>
<p>Join us as we make West View Primary School greener and more sustainable,
one step at a time!</p>

<h2>What's up in our CCA?</h2>
<p><strong><u>Blooming Gardens @ WVPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our young eco-heroes roll up their sleeves and dive into the exciting
world of gardening at West View Primary School’s Blooming Gardens! Besides
growing and harvesting their own fresh veggies, they also become plant
doctors, checking on the health of our leafy greens and ensuring our high-tech
hydroponics and aquaponics systems are in tip-top shape. It’s all about
hands-on fun, learning, and making our gardens bloom with life! 🌱🍅</p>

<p><strong><u>Farmer’s Market</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From farm to table, our CCA members turn their harvest into a buzzworthy
event at our very own Farmer’s Market! Armed with freshly picked veggies
from the Blooming Gardens, they proudly share the fruits (and greens!)
of their labour with the school community. It’s not just about sharing
the produce – it’s about spreading the joy of gardening, sustainable living,
and a healthy lifestyle. 🥬🍅🌟</p>

<p><u>Upcycling</u>
</p>
<p>Our CCA members are creative wizards when it comes to upcycling! With
a sprinkle of imagination and a dash of eco-consciousness, they have transformed
everyday items into something extraordinary. From crafting colorful fabric
coaster mats out of old clothes to designing self-watering planters using
recycled bottles, their projects are as practical as they are planet-friendly.
It’s all about turning “trash” into treasures while learning the value
of reducing waste. Who knew saving the Earth could be this much fun? ♻️✨</p>

<p><strong><u>Learning Journeys</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Adventure meets advocacy for our CCA members! They embarked on exciting
learning journeys to uncover the secrets of sustainability, gaining hands-on
insights into how we can care for our planet. But the action didn’t stop
there—they rolled up their sleeves for a litter-picking mission at the
nearby Pang Sua Pond, making it cleaner and greener for everyone to enjoy.
Every trip is an eco-adventure, where they learn, act, and make a real
difference in our community! 🌍🛤️✨</p>
