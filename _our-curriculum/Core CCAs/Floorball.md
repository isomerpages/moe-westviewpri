Brief of CCA
------------

Floorball CCA provides our girls with the opportunity to learn floorball techniques and values such as resilience, teamwork, determination and sportsmanship. These values would enable them to face challenges in the future. The girls constantly remind one another to remain committed to training. Teamwork is constantly emphasised during training and competitions. It is never one’s responsibility for the performance of the team because everyone plays a part.
