Brief of CCA
------------

Basketball is more than a game for pupils to have fun. By playing basketball, pupils develop character and values such as teamwork, sportsmanship, leadership and commitment through the training sessions and competitions. Pupils build resilience as they learn to be gracious sportsmen regardless of the outcome of the match.
