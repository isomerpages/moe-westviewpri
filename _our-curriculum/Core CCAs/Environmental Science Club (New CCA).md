<h1>Environmental Science Club (New CCA)</h1>
<h2>Brief of CCA</h2>
<p>The Environmental Science Club is a new vibrant community made up of teachers
and pupils who are dedicated to exploring, learning and acting on environmental
issues. As members of the Environmental Science Club, pupils will be involved
in activities that raise awareness about environmental issues, promote
sustainability and foster a sense of environmental stewardship within and
beyond the school environment. Through education, advocacy, and hands-on
projects, they strive to make a difference for the planet and future generations.</p>
