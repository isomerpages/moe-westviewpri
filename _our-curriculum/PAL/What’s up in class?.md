<p>The PAL programme focuses on the development of socio-emotional competencies
(SEL) in our pupils. Pupils learn how to show respect, develop responsible
decision-making skills, build confidence, be curious and creative, cooperate
and work with others. These skills are essential for pupils to excel both
academically and in life.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils are given the opportunity to explore sounds in new and creative
ways. They are challenged with a variety of musical tasks and work in groups
to be innovative in their ideas and performances. One of the musical tasks
pupils work on is writing and performing their own song.</p>
