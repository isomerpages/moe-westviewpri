<p>Teaching Science as inquiry must go beyond merely presenting the facts
and the outcomes of scientific investigations. Through inquiry learning,
we hope that every pupil from West View will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>be&nbsp;<strong><em>curious</em></strong>&nbsp;about their environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>question</em></strong>&nbsp;their&nbsp;<strong><em>observations</em></strong>&nbsp;around
them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>investigate</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>explore</em></strong>&nbsp;the
scientific concept further</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>reflect</em></strong>&nbsp;on their findings with&nbsp;<strong><em>reasoning</em></strong>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Investigate and Explore (I &amp; E) Activities</u></strong>
<br>Through I &amp; E activities during science lessons, teachers actively
engage the pupils by leading them to acquire:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>fundamental science concepts, principles and theories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>application of skills and processes of scientific inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop attitudes and values that are essential for scientific inquiry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I &amp; E activities seek to enhance the learning experiences for pupils.
Rather than memorising facts, pupils are given opportunities to explore
the concepts collaboratively. This will bring about curiosity among the
pupils. Eventually, we hope our pupils will develop a passion for Science
through this investigative and explorative approach.</p>

<p><strong><u>Explicit teaching of scientific process skills</u></strong>
<br>Scientific process skills are critical for pupils to investigate and explore
scientific concepts further. As such, opportunities are provided for pupils
to use scientific concepts and integrate skills and processes to inquire
about the things around them. Explicit teaching of process skills are conducted
termly with progression of skills as pupils advance through the different
levels. Hence, these level-appropriate skills packages are designed to
customise to the needs of the pupils based on their readiness.</p>

<p><strong><u>Questioning</u></strong>
<br>As facilitators in the classroom, teachers adopt various questioning techniques
to invoke the spirit of curiosity among the pupils. Opportunities are also
provided during Science lessons for pupils to ask questions. Through this
two-way communication and questioning between teachers and pupils, it allows
teachers to gather information on the pupils’ ‘frame of mind’ and the quality
of their understanding.</p>

<p><strong><u>Answering strategies</u></strong>
<br>To support pupils in the application of knowledge and skills in the context
of the questions/situations, the following answering strategies were developed.
These provide a thinking structure for the pupils in organising their thoughts
as they demonstrate application of knowledge and skills in the context
given in the questions.</p>
<p>The answering strategies are progressive in nature and are in tandem with
the explicit teaching of process skills to ensure alignment to pupils’
readiness level.</p>
