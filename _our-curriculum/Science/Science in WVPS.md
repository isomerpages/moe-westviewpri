<p><strong>Vision</strong>
<br>Pupils with inquiring minds</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
<br>To provide pupils with experiences which build on their interest in and
stimulate their curiosity about their environment.</p>
<p><strong>Message from HOD Science &amp; ALP&nbsp;</strong>
<br><strong>Mr Jonathan Lo&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br><em>“I believe Science education is more than acquiring facts — it is about nurturing curiosity and developing the ability to think critically about the world around us. At West View Primary, I seek to provide learning experiences that help students see the relevance of Science in their daily lives and appreciate how it shapes our future.</em>
</p>
<p><em>By engaging in inquiry and applying scientific thinking, students learn to reason with evidence, make informed decisions, and use their knowledge responsibly. My hope is to inspire every child to view Science not just as a subject, but as a way of understanding, questioning, and improving the world we live in.”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Science Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The spirit of scientific inquiry is established on the following integral
domains- (1) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (2) Skills &amp;
(3) Processes and (4) Ethics and Attitudes. Our programmes are carefully
designed for deep learning to take place amongst the pupils. Pupils are
better able to relate and make connections to their social, personal and
naturalistic environment, making learning more meaningful.</p>
