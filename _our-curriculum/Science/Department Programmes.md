<p style="color:blue" align="left"><u>Inquiry-based Learning of Science at WVPS</u></p>

The Science curriculum seeks to nurture a child as an inquirer. The main goal is for pupils to enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

In West View Primary School, teachers are the leaders of inquiry in Science learning. By adopting the 5E instructional model, teachers become facilitators of the inquiry process in the classroom. Each of the 5E defines a phase of learning. They are: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. The 5E instructional model enables pupils to have shared experiences on activities, to build on prior knowledge and personal experience, to construct meaning, and to assess their own understanding of a scientific concept continually.

  

**_Engage_** – Pupils use their prior knowledge to learn new science concepts or extend their own learning through engaging activities that promote curiosity.

**_Explore_** – Pupils deepen their understanding of the scientific concepts through hands-on activities or by doing experiments.

**_Elaborate_** – Pupils apply their knowledge to the real-world context for a more practical and broader understanding of Science.

**_Evaluate_** – Pupils consolidate and assess their learning through the various strategies like concept mapping and other formative or summative assessment tools.
