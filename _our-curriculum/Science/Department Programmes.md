<p><strong>Enhanced 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) Development</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(1) Blooming Gardens Programme @ WVPS</strong>
</p>
<p>Blooming Gardens is an enriching learning space where Science concepts
come to life. Featuring soil-based planters, hydroponics, aquaponics, and
solar panel systems, it encourages collaborative skills and deepens critical
thinking skills among students by providing opportunities to observe plant
growth, understanding sustainable farming methods in an authentic setting
and making connections to real-world sustainability efforts.</p>

<p>Aligned with the Science curriculum, students were provided with opportunities
to visit the Blooming Gardens primarily for learning, observation and transplanting
activities. &nbsp;As they examine different planting systems, they develop
critical thinking skills as they question their observations by understanding
the growth of flowering plants and observing their life cycle, making connections
to real-life experiences. Through hands-on experiences, they develop adaptive
thinking by exploring various ways to transplant germinated seedlings between
aquaponics and soil-based planters, as well as harvesting, adjusting their
techniques based on plant needs and environmental conditions. While the
Blooming Gardens serves as a platform for structured learning, it also
sparks curiosity and inventive thinking, inspiring students to consider
innovative ways to grow food sustainably.</p>

<p>Blooming Gardens cultivates not just plants, but also a mindset of inquiry
and responsibility among the students toward a greener future. &nbsp;By
reflecting on the role of urban farming and renewable energy, they nurture
an appreciation for environmental stewardship.</p>
