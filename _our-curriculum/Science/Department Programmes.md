<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning of Science @ WVPS</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary Science Curriculum seeks to nurture pupils as an inquirer
by leveraging on their interest and stimulating their curiosity about themselves
and their environment. The main goal is for pupils to have a strong foundation
in Science for life, learning, citizenry, and work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In West View Primary School, we aim to provide every child authentic learning
experiences in learning of Science through the three “IN”s - Inspire, Inquire
and Innovate. Teachers are the leaders of inquiry in Science learning.
They play an important role as facilitators for inquiry learning to take
place. Teachers will plan and engage pupils in meaningful learning experiences
through the 3C (Capture - Construct - Consolidate) Pedagogical Framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Capture</strong> – Pupils tap on their prior knowledge to learn
new science concepts and make meaningful connections between their prior
knowledge and new concepts learnt. Teachers can also arouse pupils’ interest
so that the pupils will be more motivated and stay engaged throughout the
lesson.</p>

<p><strong>Construct</strong> – Pupils will develop their scientific concepts,
skills and inculcate attitudes through hands-on learning experiences. Teachers
will adopt various questioning strategies to further deepen students’ conceptual
understanding and clarify concepts and skills taught through clear explanations.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidate</strong> – Pupils will be given opportunities to show
their understanding on various platforms. Teachers will design various
activities for pupils to apply the scientific concepts and skills in different
contexts.</p>

<br><strong><u>Enhanced 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) Development</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(1) Blooming Gardens Programme @ WVPS</strong>
<br>Blooming Gardens is an enriching learning space where Science concepts
come to life. Featuring soil-based planters, hydroponics, aquaponics, and
solar panel systems, it encourages collaborative skills and deepens critical
thinking skills among students by providing opportunities to observe plant
growth, understanding sustainable farming methods in an authentic setting
and making connections to real-world sustainability efforts.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Aligned with the Science curriculum, students were provided with opportunities
to visit the Blooming Gardens primarily for learning, observation and transplanting
activities. &nbsp;As they examine different planting systems, they develop
critical thinking skills as they question their observations by understanding
the growth of flowering plants and observing their life cycle, making connections
to real-life experiences. Through hands-on experiences, they develop adaptive
thinking by exploring various ways to transplant germinated seedlings between
aquaponics and soil-based planters, as well as harvesting, adjusting their
techniques based on plant needs and environmental conditions. While the
Blooming Gardens serves as a platform for structured learning, it also
sparks curiosity and inventive thinking, inspiring students to consider
innovative ways to grow food sustainably.</p>

<p>Blooming Gardens cultivates not just plants, but also a mindset of inquiry
and responsibility among the students toward a greener future. &nbsp;By
reflecting on the role of urban farming and renewable energy, they nurture
an appreciation for environmental stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>(2) Young Scientist Badge Scheme (YSBS)</strong>
<br>First launched in 1982, Young Scientist Badge Scheme (YSBS) is a programme
designed to inspire interest in and encourage the exploration of Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines among Primary
school students. The scheme complements formal science curriculum in schools
by providing opportunities for students to engage in STEM learning beyond
the classroom.</p>
<p>The Young Scientist Badge Scheme was designed for primary school pupils
to stimulate interest in science activities among pupils, enable pupils
to carry out self-directed activities in various disciplines of science
as well as provide opportunities for pupils to develop critical and inventive
thinking skills.</p>
<p>In 2025, Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils embark on their self-directed journey
of discovery using the Young Botanist Card. This will also be aligned to
the Blooming Gardens Programme @ WVPS that we are embarking this year which
will further enhance our pupils’ learning experience as Young Scientist.</p>

<p><strong>(3)&nbsp;E2K Science integration in regular Science curriculum lessons</strong>
<br>At West View Primary School, we believe in nurturing every student to
their full potential. This year, we piloted the integration of Excellence
2000 (E2K) Science program into our regular Science curriculum lessons
for our Primary 4 high-ability learners.</p>
<p>With the E2K Science Program, we stretch and challenge our high-ability
learners through inquiry-based, hands-on experiences that ignite curiosity
and foster a deeper understanding of scientific concepts. Under the guidance
of our E2K Science-trained teachers, students participate in learning experiences
designed to nurture a love for science by allowing them to ask questions,
design experiments, and develop their own hypotheses. Moving forward, the
department have put in place structured plans to continue the integration
of E2K Science pedagogies into our Primary 5 Science curriculum. By integrating
the E2K Science pedagogies into our curriculum, we reaffirm our dedication
to differentiated learning and the belief that every student can experience
success when given the right opportunities.</p>
