<p>To bring about the joy of learning and inquire like scientists, pupils
were provided with varied learning experiences. Through these learning
experiences, pupils are inspired by Science and provided with opportunities
to see connection between everyday phenomena and Science.&nbsp; Pupils
are seen enjoying learning Science and engage confidently in the practices
of Science as they question their observations and make conclusions based
on evidence seen and analysed.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Primary 3: Diversity of Animals</h4>
<p>As part of the P3 Science Learning Experience, pupils attended a hands-on
animal diversity workshop. With real animal specimens for pupils to observe
and explore, the pupils had an engaging and fulfilling session. Through
the workshop, the pupils learnt about specific characteristics of the major
animal groups. They also developed an appreciation for animal conservation
and maintenance of biodiversity. It was a fantastic lesson to bring science
concepts and love of nature to life.</p>

<h4>Primary 4: Heat &amp; Temperature</h4>
<p>At the Singapore Science Centre, pupils are given the opportunity to carry
out hands-on activities to strengthen their understanding on heat and temperature.
Using concepts involving good and poor conductors of heat, heat gain and
heat loss, pupils work in groups to explore and investigate challenges
presented to them.</p>

<h4>Primary 6: Adaptations of Plants and Animals</h4>
<p>Our P6 pupils attended a Science workshop on animal adaptations. During
the hands-on session, they had the opportunity to observe and handle real-life
animal specimens. Our pupils were challenged to draw links between the
features and functions of each animal’s adaptation which enables it to
survive better in its environment. The learning experiences provided opportunities
for our pupils to make connections with their daily life experiences, adding
joy to the learning process.</p>

<h4>Primary 6: Post-PSLE Experience on Vermicomposting</h4>
<p>During the Vermicomposting Programme, our P6 pupils learnt about and experienced
how worms can help with the recycling of food waste. They had to muster
their courage and practise dare while setting up the vermicomposting kits.
The compost produced was used to fertilise the various gardens in our school.</p>
<p>Acting as advocators, they went on to apply their learning by engaging
their P1 juniors. During their Vermicomposting Experience, the P1 pupils
had the opportunity to share in the learning of their P6 peers. They were
inquisitive and asked many questions. Many even cradled the worms in their
hands.</p>
