Pupils have enjoyed and benefited from the wide range of science enrichment programmes and resources provided by the Singapore Science Centre and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Visiting these two places has helped to complement the school’s science curriculum with authentic hands-on learning experiences for the pupils.

  

**Primary 4: Heat & Temperature**

  

At the Singapore Science Centre, pupils are given the opportunity to carry out hands-on activities to strengthen their understanding on heat and temperature. Using concepts involving good and poor conductors of heat, heat gain and heat loss, pupils work in groups to explore and investigate challenges presented to them.

**Primary 5: Diversity of Cells**

  

At the Singapore Science Centre, pupils are engaged in activities where they view various microorganisms and cells (e.g. cheek and leaf cells) microscopically and understand the application for using the microscope.

**Primary 6: Adaptations of Plants and Animals**

  

Through the learning experiences provided at LKCNHM, pupils learn to appreciate the biodiversity around them and examine real specimens in a novel situation through a hands-on session. This has allowed pupils to further broaden their knowledge on the features and adaptations of these plants and animals.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme**

  

The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme for pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. The programme engages pupils in scientific investigations involving advanced science concepts. It aims to engage pupils in scientific inquiry that will help them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
