The main focus of our mathematics curriculum is problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems.

  

In West View, we want every pupils to be a self-directed and confident problem solver. At the end of their primary school journey with us, our pupils will have:

  

1.  Ability to solve problems in real-life context
2.  Ability to communicate mathematics
3.  Interest and enjoyment in learning mathematics

  

Through the varied learning experiences provided, our pupils will be able to acquire mathematical concepts and skills. On top of that, our pupils will also develop in them, the required cognitive and metacognitive skills. We want to ensure that our pupils to have a strong foundation in order to pursue mathematics at the next higher level.

**Factual Fluency**

  

It is important for pupils to be able to recall basic Maths facts fluently. Math facts are important because they form the building blocks for higher-level math concepts. When pupils master his/her math facts, more memory spaces will be free up for them to learn more difficult mathematical concepts.

Various modes were used to conduct Factual Fluency. One example is the use of technology: Ipads were allocated to every pupil. The pupils were timed to complete each question. The timed practice aids the pupils in improving on their speed and accuracy.
