The main focus of our mathematics curriculum is problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems.

  

In West View, we want every pupils to be a self-directed and confident problem solver. At the end of their primary school journey with us, our pupils will have:

  

1.  Ability to solve problems in real-life context
2.  Ability to communicate mathematics
3.  Interest and enjoyment in learning mathematics

  

Through the varied learning experiences provided, our pupils will be able to acquire mathematical concepts and skills. On top of that, our pupils will also develop in them, the required cognitive and metacognitive skills. We want to ensure that our pupils to have a strong foundation in order to pursue mathematics at the next higher level.
