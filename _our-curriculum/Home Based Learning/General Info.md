# Pupils' Login Time for SLS
In order to prevent system access issues cause by a high volume of students logging in to SLS simultaneously, we have implemented a staggered access schedule for pupils. Students have the option to complete the offline assignment either before or after their assigned staggered access schedule.

<table style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">
<tbody>
  <tr style="font-weight: bold;">
    <td>Levels</td>
    <td>Pupils' login time</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P1</td>
    <td rowspan="2">1:00 p.m.</td>
    <td rowspan="6">Students will be provided with a full day to complete their SLS tasks and assignments.<br><br>(Deadline of completion: 11:59 p.m. of the day)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>P2</td>
