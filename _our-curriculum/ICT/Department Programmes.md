online behaviour, aligned with the objectives of Safer Internet Dayâ€”to
empower individuals to use technology safely, critically, and positively.</p>

<p>This initiative encourages self-directed learning by allowing students
to pursue topics they are passionate about. Through exploration and inquiry,
they develop critical thinking and research skills while deepening their
understanding of subjects beyond the curriculum. By nurturing curiosity
and independence, SIL cultivates a love for lifelong learning and empowers
students to take ownership of their educational journey.</p>
