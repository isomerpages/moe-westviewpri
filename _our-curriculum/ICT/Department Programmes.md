<p><strong>Safer Internet Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Safer Internet Week is an annual event that promotes responsible and respectful
online behaviour, aligned with the objectives of Safer Internet Day—to
empower students to use technology safely, critically, and positively.</p>
<p>This year, the week featured engaging assembly talks on online safety,
digital etiquette, and protecting personal data. Recess activities, supported
by our Parents in Action (PiA), included a Cyber Safe Scavenger Hunt and
Online Safety Connect Four, giving students fun, interactive ways to reinforce
safe online practices. Pupils also consolidated their learning through
SLS games.</p>
<p>Through these activities, we aim to equip students with the knowledge
and skills to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly.</p>

<p><strong>Be Cyber-Bully Proof</strong>
</p>
<p>Be Cyber-Bully Proof is an annual event that raises awareness about cyberbullying
and promotes a culture of kindness and respect online.</p>
<p>The week begins with an assembly talk on recognising, responding to, and
preventing cyberbullying. This is followed by recess activities planned
and led by our student leaders, empowering them to engage their peers in
interactive games and discussions on standing up against cyberbullying
and fostering a supportive online community.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, we encourage students to be proactive in promoting
a safe and inclusive online environment, empowering them to support one
another and take a stand against cyberbullying.</p>

<p><strong>Student-Initiated Learning</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)</strong> provides protected time
for students to explore topics of personal interest, fostering curiosity
and independent learning. The five key areas of SIL follow the <strong>STARS</strong> framework:</p>

</div>
<p>This initiative encourages self-directed learning by allowing students
to pursue topics they are passionate about. Through exploration and inquiry,
they develop critical thinking and research skills while deepening their
understanding of subjects beyond the curriculum. By nurturing curiosity
and independence, SIL cultivates a love for lifelong learning and empowers
students to take ownership of their educational journey.</p>
