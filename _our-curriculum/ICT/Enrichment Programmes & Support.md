<p><strong>Cyber Warriors and ICT Rep Training</strong>
</p>
<p>This enrichment programme equips selected pupils with essential digital
skills and leadership abilities. ICT Reps, chosen from P3 to P6, are trained
to support teachers by setting up IT equipment before lessons and switching
them off at the end. They also provide technical support to their peers
during ICT lessons, ensuring a smooth and effective learning experience.</p>
<p>Selected pupils from this group, as well as from the Student Leaders,
are further trained to become Cyber Warriors. They receive advanced training
in digital safety and responsible technology use, empowering them to positively
influence their peers. Cyber Warriors lead recess activities and assemblies,
spreading awareness about safe online practices and encouraging positive
digital behaviour within the school community.</p>
