<p><strong>Vision<br></strong>Self-directed and future-ready responsible
digital learners</p>
<p><strong>Mission<br></strong>Purposeful and meaningful use of technology
in Teaching and Learning to nurture E21CC future-ready learners</p>
<p><strong>Message from Subject Head ICT, Mdm Chen Jing Ting</strong>
</p>
<p>As a Subject Head in ICT, I believe in the purposeful and meaningful use
of technology to enhance teaching and learning, nurturing self-directed,
future-ready, and responsible digital learners. Through a well-designed
ICT curriculum, effective integration of EdTech, and a robust school infrastructure,
I strive to equip students with 21st-century competencies while empowering
teachers to create engaging learning experiences. My goal is to build a
technology-enabled environment that supports innovation, collaboration,
and lifelong learning.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum Framework &amp; Description</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Committee Focus</strong>
</p>
<p>Our programmes are aligned with the Transforming Education through Technology
Masterplan 2030, which guides schools in leveraging technology to enhance
teaching and learning. Our ICT committee is committed to equipping both
students and teachers with essential digital competencies while fostering
a safe and responsible online environment.</p>
<p>Our focus is on three key areas:</p>
<p><strong>1. Digital Literacy &amp; Technological Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>Aligned with the Find, Think, Apply, Create (FTAC) framework, our programme
aims to nurture pupils into confident, critical, and responsible users
of digital technologies. This holistic approach ensures that pupils are
empowered to take ownership of their learning, using technology effectively
for research, collaboration, and problem-solving in an ever-evolving digital
landscape.</p>

<p><strong>2. Integrating EdTech to Enrich Teaching and Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers are empowered through professional development to design technology-enhanced
lessons that promote interactive and collaborative learning. By leveraging
EdTech tools and platforms, lessons become more engaging and tailored to
diverse learning needs.</p>
<p>In our classrooms, we harness e-Pedagogy to foster active learning. Through
the purposeful use of technology, we create engaging, data-informed, and
student-centred experiences. Teachers refer to the EdTech Pedagogical Scaffold
to guide the design and facilitation of technology-enhanced learning, ensuring
meaningful and effective integration throughout the lesson.</p>

<p><strong>3. Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>We prioritise the well-being of our pupils in the digital realm. Our Cyber
Wellness programme uses the Sense-Think-Act approach to develop a childâ€™s
instinct to act responsibly in cyberspace. This approach is grounded in
three guiding principles:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Respect for Self and Others: Developing an understanding of the impact
of online actions and recognising the importance of respecting oneself
and others in the digital space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe and Responsible Use: Reflecting on how to use technology safely,
responsibly, and ethically, while safeguarding personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive Peer Influence: Encouraging pupils to make responsible decisions
and influence their peers to contribute positively to the online community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through engaging activities and lessons, we equip pupils with the knowledge
and skills to navigate the internet safely and responsibly. They learn
to be ethical, responsible users of technology, fostering a safe and positive
online environment. Our cyber wellness education also helps pupils develop
self-management skills, enabling them to make informed decisions and maintain
a healthy balance in technology use.</p>

<p><strong>Partnership with Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that a strong partnership with parents is crucial in reinforcing
ICT learning and Cyber Wellness at home. We provide resources and workshops
to help parents stay informed about the latest digital trends and equip
them with strategies to support their children's digital journey. By working
together, we aim to create a consistent and supportive environment for
our pupils both at school and at home.</p>
