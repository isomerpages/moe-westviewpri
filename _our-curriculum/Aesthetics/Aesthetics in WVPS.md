<p><strong>Curriculum Framework &amp; Description</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Music Curriculum Concept</strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary and Lower Secondary Music curriculum seeks to develop musical
understanding through the three Musical Processes of Listening, Creating
and Performing. As illustrated in Figure 2.1 below, these three Musical
Processes (i.e. the three overlapping circles in the centre of diagram)
are core to the Curriculum Concept and are inter-related and inter-dependent
in practice.</p>
