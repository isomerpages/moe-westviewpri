_"Every child is unique with talents waiting to be discovered and developed. Opportunities are provided through Aesthetics and CCAs for pupils to discover and develop their talents. Through the learning process, pupils develop resilience and are equipped with life skills and values; becoming passionate learners and confident leaders. With encouragement and support, every child is capable of producing his/her very own masterpiece."_
