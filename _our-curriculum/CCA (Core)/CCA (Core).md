In West View Primary, we strongly believe that every West Viewan is a talented pupil. For our CCA, Co-Curricular Activities, we offer both modular and core CCA (as shown in the diagram below) to provide our pupils with the opportunity to develop their interests and talents, while developing their character, values and leadership. Our CCA also serve as a common space for friendships and social integration.

Core (CCAs)
-----------

Our core CCAs, which is known as CCA in short, provide opportunities for pupils to maximise their potential and excel in the pursuit of their interests and talents beyond the classrooms. Pupils who show talents in their CCA will be further developed to challenge themselves through developmentally appropriate competitions and performances within and beyond school. We encourages all pupils to participate in at least one CCA, as an after-school activity.
