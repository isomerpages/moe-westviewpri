Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Chinese Dance)
----------------------------------------------------------

Our school's Chinese Dance took part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in July. Because of COVID-19, the Chinese dance members could only have their dance practice through Zoom for a long period of time. Although they had less than 4 months to practice face to face and prepare for SYF, they really treasure this opportunity and put up an awesome performance.
