Chinese Street Dance Competition, jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) and Maxkios aims to use music and dance to spur pupils to be interested in learning Chinese Language.

We hope more pupils will participate to experience the beauty of Chinese Language and love the language!

# CCA Certificate of Accomplishment
Every year in term 3, we recognise the hard work and commitment of our P6 pupils in various CCA groups as they step down from their CCA duties. The past 3 years have been challenging for our current P6 cohort. 

For Sports CCA groups, the National School Games were suspended in 2021 and part of 2022 and pupils in our performing arts CCAs were not able to participate in the highly anticipated SYF competition in 2020. 

On top of that, much of the CCA sessions from 2021 and to early 2022 were held virtually. Nevertheless, our P6 pupils took these changes in their stride, persevered and attended their CCA sessions both physically and virtually.
