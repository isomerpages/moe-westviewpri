THE PRESIDENT'S AWARD FOR TEACHERS (PAT) AND THE OUTSTANDING YOUTH IN EDUCATION AWARD (OYEA) 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every year, two national awards are given out to teachers in Singapore to recognise their professional excellence. They are the President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) and the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA).  
  
The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) gives national recognition to experienced teachers who are role models for the teaching profession. These teachers personify deep passion for teaching and inspire both their students and peers through their words and deeds.  
  
The Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) gives national recognition to young teachers who are role models for the teaching profession. These teachers personify youthful idealism, energy and enthusiasm, and inspire both their students and peers through their words and deeds. Educators who are 35 years and younger are eligible for the award. Hence, OYEA 2023 is open to educators who are born on or after 30 June 1988.  
  
  
Nominations for PAT 2023 and OYEA 2023 are now open and will close on Wednesday, 11 January 2023.  
  
We would like to invite you and your child/ward to submit your nomination(s) for any deserving teacher(s) whom you know by clicking on the URLs or scanning the QR codes below.   
  
West View Primary would like to encourage you to take some time to express your appreciation for our excellent educators!
