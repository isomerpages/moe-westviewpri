<p>📝 Dear Ex-Westviewans,
<br>
<br>With Teachers' Day just around the corner, let's shower our amazing educators
with gratitude! 🎉 They've shaped our journey, now it's time to share how
they've touched our lives! ❤️
<br>
<br>💝 Join us in celebrating our teachers! Share your heartfelt messages
through the FormSG below. The school will be open on 4 Sept (after Teachers'
Day celebrations) for meet-ups from 1030-1130 a.m. Should you wish to meet
your teachers, please make prior arrangements directly with the teachers
as they may have other commitments after the celebration.
<br>
<br>✨ As our P6s prepare for PSLE, share your words of wisdom and encouragement
too! Let's inspire the next generation of Westviewans! 💪
