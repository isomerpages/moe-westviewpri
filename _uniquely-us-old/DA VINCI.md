<h1><strong>DA VINCI</strong></h1>
<p>The DA VINCI at West View Primary School seeks to nurture every child’s
potential, acknowledging that each student possesses unique combinations
of talents and abilities. Through a thoughtfully structured curriculum,
the programme provides students with varied opportunities to maximize their
strengths and reach their fullest potential, and is designed to develop
critical thinking, creativity, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The DA VINCI consists of three key programme:</p>

this component will empower students to express their ideas clearly and
confidently, preparing them for future opportunities to showcase their

<p><strong>Capstone Project</strong>  <strong>using Design Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>Capstone Project will allow students to apply design thinking as they
create and present meaningful projects. This experience will integrate
the skills learned throughout the DA VINCI Programme and provide them with
an opportunity to showcase their growth.</p>
<p>As part of our<strong> DA VINCI</strong>, students have the opportunity
to engage in cross-cultural exchanges with partner schools. They will participate
in cross-cultural activities, gain new insights, and build friendships
with students from partner schools. We are confident that this experience
will broaden their horizons and deepen their learning journey.</p>
<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme</strong> includes:</p>
<p><strong>Overseas Immersion Programme with Hong Kong Schools: Tai Po Old Market Public School (Plover Cove) and Lee Chi Tat Memorial School</strong>
</p>
<p>This overseas exchange offered students firsthand experience with Hong
Kong’s education system, encouraging cultural exchange, and fostering international
friendships. The partner schools offer programmes related to both sustainability
and technology, which would provide valuable exposure and an excellent
platform for showcasing to our students and teachers.</p>
<p><strong>School Visits by Singapore International School, Vietnam, and Xi’an Gao Xin No.1 Primary School, China</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students have the chance to host and interact with students from these
esteemed schools, developing global perspectives and understanding through
shared activities.</p>
<p><u>Internationalisation Programme with </u><strong><u>Singapore International School Vietnam</u></strong>
</p>
<p>P5 students and students from Singapore International School Vietnam were
immersed in an array of engaging learning experiences that involves an
exchange of cross-cultural performances from both schools. These include
presentation of cultures and festivals from both schools, singing and dance
performances as well as fashion parade by pupils from Vietnam. P5 cultural
buddies also interacted with their buddies from Vietnam during recess and
formed friendship bonds with lasting memories.</p>
