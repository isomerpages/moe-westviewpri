<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Competent &amp; Confident users of the English Language.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To provide an engaging learning environment to develop our pupils into
confident and competent users of English Language in speech and writing.</p>
<p><strong>Message from</strong>&nbsp;<strong>HOD English Language &amp; School Library</strong> 
<br><strong>Mr Matthew Chua</strong> 
<br><em>"In this globalised and delicate world, it is important that the pupils are equipped with the skills to be affective communicators who seek to understand and be understood."</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Message from LH/ English Language</strong> 
<br><strong>Mrs Ho-Tan Soon Hui</strong> 
<br><em>"Every child is different and has his own potential. As an educator, I believe in encouraging our pupils to focus on their unique strengths to reach their fullest potential.</em>
</p>
<p><em>I am committed to build on a culture of continuous learning and improvement in the school so that teachers can be empowered to fulfil the potential of every child in WVPS."</em>
</p>
<p><strong>English Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>English is the common language that facilitates bonding among the different
ethnic and cultural groups. On the global platform, English allows Singaporeans
to tap into a knowledge-based economy where English is the main&nbsp;<em>lingua franca</em>&nbsp;of
the Internet, of science and technology, and of world trade.</p>
<p>The development of multiple competencies will enable our young to capitalise
on the rich opportunities of the digital age, while maintaining a strong
foundation in the language. It will allow our students to engage meaningfully
and confidently with the wider and more diverse communities both in and
out of Singapore.</p>

<p>The following diagram presents the key features of the&nbsp;<em>EL Syllabus</em>&nbsp;undergirded
by the principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS) and EL teaching
processes (ACOLADE). Drawing on the model of effective teaching in the
Singapore Teaching Practice, a pedagogical emphasis on Multiliteracies,
Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue in the EL classroom ensures
effective and affective language use for all EL learners. The approach
to language teaching and learning ensures a firm and rich foundation for
all.</p>

<summary>What's Up In Class?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The English Language curriculum aims to develop effective and affective
language use in our pupils through</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>listening, reading and viewing from print, non-print and digital networked
resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>speaking, writing and representing in standard English appropriate for
different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using standard English grammar and vocabulary accurately and appropriately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using English with impact, effect and affect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guided by CLLIPS as explained below, teachers will apply knowledge of
the disciplinarity of EL and guide their pupils effectively and confidently
towards a deeper understanding of the language and its use, and facilitate
the transfer of learning.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Contextualisation - pupils learning the English language in authentic
and meaningful contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learner-centredness - teaching is differentiated according to pupils’
readiness, interests and learning profiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning-focused interaction - pupils working together actively to boost
their confidence in the use of the language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration - teaching of receptive skills, productive skills and metalanguage
by building on one another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process orientation - teacher models, scaffolds and differentiates the
learning of language skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spiral progression - teaching of the English Language will be at increasing
levels of difficulty and sophistication</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In West View, our pupils acquire the English Language through the exploration
of thematic texts. While exploring the text and enquiring about the theme,
West Viewans will acquire the metalanguage through a myriad of activities.</p>
<p>West Viewans are given varied opportunities in speaking and writing to
apply the metalanguage learnt. They are also equipped with the correct
learning dispositions, allowing them not to be just effective communicators
but also affective ones.</p>

<p><strong><u>Gr8 quiz</u></strong>
<br>Gr8 quiz or commonly known as Grammar Fluency is conducted in Primary
1 to Primary 6 classes a few times a week during English lessons. It is
conducted as a reinforcement of grammar rules before a grammar lesson.</p>
<p>Using grammar quizzes allows pupils to revise and understand a particular
grammar item before moving on to more complex grammatical structures. Pupils
gain confidence and they are more familiar with the grammar rules too.</p>

<h4>READ Programme</h4>
<p>During READ periods, P1 and P2 West Viewans will be actively engaged in
reading graded books that allow them to inquire, relate and explore. These
differentiated tasks in the READ booklets support the individual needs
of the pupils where they explore a variety of graded books from different
genres. After reading the text, they will be supported with different reading
extension activities to provide them opportunities to show their understanding
and practise their literacy skills.</p>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p><strong><u>Our Philosophy</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s reading philosophy is based on i.R.E.A.D,&nbsp; which West
Viewans Inquire, Relate, Explore, Appreciate and Discern.</p>
<p>As West Viewans explore thematic texts, they are also provided with suggestions
to read other similar themed texts in various genres. Not only that, pupils
are enthused to read and be curious about the world around them through
weekly Extensive Reading lessons.</p>
<p>i.R.E.A.D@West View customises a set of structured reading programmes
that aims to help our pupils pursue reading as an enjoyable activity. Some
of the reading activities include READ periods and book floods by providing
a variety of books in the class for the pupils to choose from.</p>
<p><strong><u>Literature Appreciation for Primary 3 and 4 pupils</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For our Middle Primary West Viewans, apart from the fortnightly library
visits, they will embark on a literature appreciation programme which allows
them to inquire, relate, explore and appreciate. They will understand and
appreciate the literature stylings of Roald Dahl.</p>

<p><strong><u>Primary 5 Literature Programme</u></strong>
<br>Our Primary 5 pupils had the opportunity to work alongside with ASCD (Association
for Supervision and Curriculum Development) on a project with our local
authors in Singapore. The purpose of this project is to encourage the reading
of Singapore literature by our pupils with their teachers and the local
authors.</p>
<p>Our pupils read a chosen book and explored selected reading activities.
They even met up with the local authors who engaged the pupils with a presentation,
activities and an insightful question and answer session.</p>

<p><strong><u>Current Affairs for Primary 5 and 6 pupils</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At West View Primary, we believe in helping our pupils become discerning
readers. Thus, the Upper Primary pupils are exposed to news articles from
The Little Red Dot fortnightly to inquire and relate to the events that
are not just happening around them in Singapore but also around the world.
The pupils get to read and discuss the articles they have read. Not only
does the news broaden their general knowledge, but it also allows them
to understand the functional use of the language.</p>

<p><strong><u>Primary 5 Persuasive Speaking Programme</u></strong> 
<br>After going through different experiences that teach and strengthen the
fundamentals of speaking, our Primary 5 pupils will learn the art of persuasive
speaking. Through this programme, they will learn the importance of the
impact of words and coupled with the correct delivery, they convey different
purpose, meaning and emotions. From this experience, pupils learn not only
to be effective but also convincing speakers.</p>

<h5><strong>Literacy Support Programmes</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Through specialised early intervention programmes, learning support is
provided for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils who need targeted help with
the English Language. These pupils are selected through careful screening.
The programme focuses on building English language skills that pupils used
to decode and be more confident users of the language.</p>
<p>LSP is conducted half an hour a day (in small groups of 8 to 10 pupils).</p>
