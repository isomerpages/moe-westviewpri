Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
------------------------------

In West View Primary, we strongly believe that every West Viewan is a talented pupil. For our CCA, we offer both modular and core CCA (as shown in the diagram below) to provide our pupils with the opportunity to develop their interests and talents, while developing their character, values and leadership.

CCAs also serve as a common space for friendships and social integration. Our school-based Modular CCA, also known as STRIVE@WVPS, expose our pupils to a broad range of experiences in the various domains such as Sports and Games, Performing Arts, Visual Arts and Life Skills. These fun-filled experiences include archery, balloon sculpting, beat box, inline skating, speech and drama and mind-mapping. All pupils from Primary Three to Six participate in STRIVE@WVPS during curriculum hours.
