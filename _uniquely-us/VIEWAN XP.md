<p><strong>Description of Signature Programm</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond mastering the subject content, we believe that pupils must be equipped
in the subject discipline with the necessary skills, dispositions and E21CC
competencies to face the future. As they learn best from experience, we
strive to enrich their learning through our school-based redesigned&nbsp;<strong><em>VIEWAN&nbsp;XP Design Thinking </em></strong>curriculum<em>.</em>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 1</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Based on the theme,&nbsp;<em>My school, My friends and I</em>, Primary
1 pupils are provided with the positive experiences to feel safe and happy
in school. Through authentic and meaningful activities, pupils feel emotionally
and socially secure for learning to take place. Pupils explored the different
places in school to familiarise themselves with key places in the school.
They were also given authentic experiences to interact positively with
teachers and peers.</p>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 2</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Based on the theme, ‘Caring and Appreciating Nature and Animals’, our
pupils are given the opportunities to take care of butterflies. They explore
and discover the amazing life cycle of a butterfly through their exploration
and interaction with their peers.</p>
<p>The authentic learning experiences allow pupils to demonstrate the values
of excellence; where they strive to do their best in caring and appreciating
the animals found in nature.</p>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 3</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils explore the theme on accepting self and others through various
novel learning opportunities. They discover and learn the different cultures
(the four different races) and cultural sensitivity in an authentic setting.</p>
<p>Pupils embark on a learning trail where they explored musical instruments
- drums, symbols /colours and mannerism across the four different cultural
groups.</p>
<p>Through this situated interest, pupils discover that everyone is unique.
They realise that they must learn to respect and appreciate their unique
characteristics. They also learn more about themselves and what makes them
distinct from their friends and how they relate to others.</p>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 4</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils visit the Singapore Zoological Gardens, as a shared learning experience
to learn about the importance of animal conservation. Through this authentic
learning, pupils acquire world-wise knowledge on why conservation is not
only important for animals but all living things.</p>
<p>They learn how interactions between people and others (animals and environment)
can bring about positive or negative impacts. The novel opportunities in
the Zoo provide the learning experiences that lead pupils to discover how
they can play their part in controlling the spread of diseases carried
by animals. They will then present their findings in an information report
collaboratively after the learning journey. Pupils gain knowledge on how
people play an important role in conservation to ensure continuity of life
and availability of resources.</p>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 5</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils are provided authentic learning experiences to bring about the
enduring understanding of water conservation. The learning experiences
provide them with world-wise knowledge in understanding Singapore’s water
challenges and solutions to achieve water sustainability.</p>
<p>Pupils take part in water rationing exercise to understand that clean
water is an essential and a basic need for human survival as well as other
living things. They learn that water is a limited resource in Singapore
and it can be polluted. They realise the importance of water conservation
and why it must be treated.</p>
<p>In groups, pupils will then design a poster on water conservation and
reflect on what some of the ways to conserve water are and the impact on
living things if water is not available. They also discover how their actions
will impact the environment affecting the quality of the water.</p>

<p><strong><u>PRIMARY 6</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 6 pupils&nbsp;made use of our school’s learning walls to find
out more about the impacts of energy wastage in Singapore. Back in the
classrooms, they work together in groups during curriculum to discuss on
the importance of energy conservation. At home, they collaborated further
by creating a presentation together to advocate the importance of energy
conservation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The pupils have really demonstrated what they had learnt from previous
years of ICT baseline skills. They were able to collaborate effectively
as a class to research on the content of the presentation and as a group
to do up a Google Slide presentation. All of them had indeed emerged stronger
due to the opportunities by COVID -19 pandemic.</p>
