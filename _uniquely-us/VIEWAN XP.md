**<u>VIEWAN XP (Experience)</u>**

Beyond mastering the subject content, we believe that pupils must be equipped in the subject discipline with the necessary skills, dispositions and competencies to face the future. As they learn best from experience, we strive to enrich their learning through our school-based curriculum, **_VIEWAN XP (Experience)_**.

**PRIMARY 1**

  

Based on the theme, _My school, My friends and I_, Primary 1 pupils are provided with the positive experiences to feel safe and happy in school. Through authentic and meaningful activities, pupils feel emotionally and socially secure for learning to take place. Pupils explored the different places in school to familiarise themselves with key places in the school. They were also given authentic experiences to interact positively with teachers and peers.

**PRIMARY 2**

  

Based on the theme, ‘Caring and Appreciating Nature and Animals’, our pupils are given the opportunities to take care of butterflies. They explore and discover the amazing life cycle of a butterfly through their exploration and interaction with their peers.

  

The authentic learning experiences allow pupils to demonstrate the values of excellence; where they strive to do their best in caring and appreciating the animals found in nature.

**PRIMARY 3**

  

Pupils explore the theme on accepting self and others through various novel learning opportunities. They discover and learn the different cultures (the four different races) and cultural sensitivity in an authentic setting.

  

Pupils embark on a learning trail where they explored musical instruments - drums, symbols /colours and mannerism across the four different cultural groups.

  

Through this situated interest, pupils discover that everyone is unique. They realise that they must learn to respect and appreciate their unique characteristics. They also learn more about themselves and what makes them distinct from their friends and how they relate to others.
