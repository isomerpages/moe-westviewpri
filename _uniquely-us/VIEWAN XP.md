**<u>VIEWAN XP (Experience)</u>**

Beyond mastering the subject content, we believe that pupils must be equipped in the subject discipline with the necessary skills, dispositions and competencies to face the future. As they learn best from experience, we strive to enrich their learning through our school-based curriculum, **_VIEWAN XP (Experience)_**.

**PRIMARY 1**

  

Based on the theme, _My school, My friends and I_, Primary 1 pupils are provided with the positive experiences to feel safe and happy in school. Through authentic and meaningful activities, pupils feel emotionally and socially secure for learning to take place. Pupils explored the different places in school to familiarise themselves with key places in the school. They were also given authentic experiences to interact positively with teachers and peers.
