<h1>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): FRIEND of Earth</h1><p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides the opportunity for pupils to appreciate the relevance and usefulness of what they learn in the classrooms for the application to the real world.</p><p>In West View Primary School,&nbsp;<em>ALP: FRIEND of Earth</em>, provides our pupils with opportunities to investigate and explore in Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STREAM) curriculum. Through inquiry-based and experiential learning, pupils build on what they learn about environmental education in the classroom and connect the learning to situations that are happening around the world</p><p>It is envisioned that Every West Viewan is a&nbsp;<strong><em>FRIEND of Earth</em></strong>, whose role as a :</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>F</strong>acilitator</p></li><li><p><strong>R</strong>esearcher</p></li><li><p><strong>I</strong>nnovator</p></li><li><p><strong>E</strong>xplorer</p></li><li><p><strong>N</strong>aturalist and</p></li><li><p><strong>D</strong>iplomat</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>will enable them to acquire the necessary knowledge, values and dispositions to make environmentally friendly decisions and proactively take an active part in bettering lives.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2OuUc5Qsxk"></iframe></div><h5><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></h5><p><strong>3R Initiatives</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond just knowing the facts (head) about Reducing, Reusing and Recycling and on how to save the environment during Science, Reading and Art programmes, pupils learn to cherish the miracle in Mother Nature, appreciate the enduring understanding of how Man impacts the environment and be grateful how Mother Nature provides for and affects us (hearts). Through their actions (hands), pupils play the roles as Facilitators and Diplomats to develop pro-social behaviours and educate others the cause of their actions, such as reducing food waste, food recycling, saving water and electricity as well as vermicomposting. They also use recycled materials to create amazing 3D art work through visual arts.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR2ko6acVv6uk6n7Sb80CclBIPZhE6kMvzZ-qd65Nz58jFYGU-r3USGNSHw0PChFCFKbkkCznObO7lO/embed?start=false&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p><strong>Sustainability Efforts @ WVPS: Black Soldier Fly (BSF) Upcycling Project</strong></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tCyb5LR1X70?si=G2uxMOpgTAIY1j6j"></iframe></div><p>As part of the school’s initiative towards promoting sustainability, the Environment Corp Prefects, from Primary Four to Primary Six, embarked on an exciting journey with the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae.</p><p>With the guidance of teachers from the ALP team, the prefects had hands-on experience in taking care and maintaining the BSF larvae.&nbsp; The BSF larvae were fed with food waste collected from the school canteen daily. It is heartening to see the prefects showing such enthusiasm and dare (to touch the larvae) in caring for the BSF.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>During the weekly clean-up, the prefects had to remove all the uneaten food left in the bin. We are heartened to see the “twinkle” in their eyes as they sieve for frass. The frass collected was used as a fertilizer for the plants in the school. &nbsp;</p><p>Through this project, the prefects not only get to witness the life cycle of the BSF and learn about the impact these flies have on food waste management, but they also got to play a part in the whole cycle of reducing and converting food waste into useful fertilizer (frass) for the plants.&nbsp; They act as advocates through their act of influencing sound sustainability practices amongst their peers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We hope that the hands-on experience would spur the pupils to keep up their efforts in creating a sustainable environment and be aware that they can make a difference, as Eco-stewards of the environment!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Sustainability Efforts @ WVPS: Black Soldier Fly (BSF) Upcycling Project" src="/images/Sustainability%20Efforts%20WVPS%20Black%20Soldier%20Fly%20(BSF)%20Upcycling%20Project.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Pupils visiting the learning walls to gather information on BSF (Black Soldier Fly)" src="/images/Pupils%20visiting%20the%20learning%20walls%20to%20gather%20information%20on%20BSF%20(Black%20Soldier%20Fly).jpg"></div><p><strong>Creative Problem Solving</strong></p><p>As Innovator and Explorer, pupils discover new ways of doing things in authentic situations through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines.</p><p>Through robotics and coding, P4 and P5 pupils think critically and explore different ways to address authentic issues on energy consumption and wastage. They participate in Sembcorp Greenwave Project to apply their knowledge and skills in Science and Technology to put into action their care for the environment.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Creative Problem Solving" src="/images/Creative%20Problem%20Solving.jpg"></div><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4iZBQALyio"></iframe></div><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fc93md-tTvU"></iframe></div><p><strong>Overseas Immersion Programme</strong></p><p>Our P4 and 5 pupils who have shown their commitment in learning and excelled are given the opportunities to experience how lessons on environmental studies are conducted in Perth. These experiences provide our pupils not only the opportunities to witness how pupils in other countries are tackling environmental issues but also to appreciate the diversity across cultures and countries.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Overseas Immersion Programme" src="/images/Overseas%20Immersion%20Programme.jpg"></div><h2>Awards &amp; Recognition</h2><p><strong><u>The School Green Award (Yellow Flame)</u></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 30%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Uniquely Us/ALP/image7.jpg"></div><p>The School Green Award, launched by the Singapore Environment Council,&nbsp; is a prestigious recognition that celebrates and acknowledges outstanding achievements in environmental sustainability and green initiatives within educational institutions. This award aims to encourage schools to adopt and promote eco-friendly practices, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility among students, staff, and the broader school community.</p><p>In recognition of our outstanding efforts and community outreach in fostering environmental sustainability, the school was awarded the Yellow Flame award. This award celebrates the school's commitment to creating a positive impact on the environment and engaging the community in sustainable practices through the partnership with various stakeholders, including North West Community Development Council, National Parks Board and Zhenghua Grassroots. Our signature programme, the Black Soldier Fly, has also been lauded by residents and other educational institutions in its use to reduce food waste.</p><p>West View’s sustainability initiatives have already made a substantial impact, not only within school but also in inspiring positive change in the community. Looking forward, the school remains committed to expanding its sustainability efforts and fostering even greater community engagement.</p><p><strong><u>MOE Innergy Award (Bronze Award)</u></strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Uniquely Us/ALP/image6.png"></div><p>West View Primary School has been honoured with the distinguished Bronze Award in the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Innergy Awards for its pioneering sustainability efforts through the use of Black Soldier Fly in reducing food waste. This recognition underscores the school's commitment to innovative and environmentally conscious practices in education.</p><p>West View has been at the forefront of sustainable education, with a particular focus on Black Soldier Fly as a groundbreaking initiative. The school implemented the Black Soldier Fly programme as part of its commitment to waste reduction and sustainable agriculture. The larvae of Black Soldier Fly efficiently convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost and protein-rich insect biomass.</p><p>The black soldier fly farming initiative has played a pivotal role in waste reduction within the school. Organic waste from the school canteen and other sources is efficiently processed by the larvae, resulting in reduced landfill waste and the production of valuable resources.</p><p>West View has also seamlessly integrated black soldier fly farming into the curriculum, offering students interdisciplinary learning opportunities. Students not only gained practical knowledge in sustainable agriculture but also developed a profound understanding of the ecological importance of insects in waste management.</p><p>West View is dedicated to expanding its sustainable initiatives. The school envisions further integration of innovative and environmentally conscious practices into its curriculum, creating a lasting impact on students and the community.</p><p></p>
