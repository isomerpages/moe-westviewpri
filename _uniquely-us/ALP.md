<h1>Eco-stewardship Programme @ WVPS</h1>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides the opportunity for pupils
to appreciate the relevance and usefulness of what they learn in the classrooms
for the application to the real world.</p>
<p>In West View Primary School,&nbsp;<em>ALP: FRIEND of Earth</em>, provides
our pupils with opportunities to investigate and explore in Science, Technology,
Reading, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STREAM) curriculum. Through
inquiry-based and experiential learning, pupils build on what they learn
about environmental education in the classroom and connect the learning
to situations that are happening around the world</p>
<p>It is envisioned that Every West Viewan is a&nbsp;<strong><em>FRIEND of Earth</em></strong>,

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>3R Initiatives</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond just knowing the facts (head) about Reducing, Reusing and Recycling
and on how to save the environment during Science, Reading and Art programmes,
pupils learn to cherish the miracle in Mother Nature, appreciate the enduring
understanding of how Man impacts the environment and be grateful how Mother
Nature provides for and affects us (hearts). Through their actions (hands),
pupils play the roles as Facilitators and Diplomats to develop pro-social
behaviours and educate others the cause of their actions, such as reducing
food waste, food recycling, saving water and electricity as well as vermicomposting.
They also use recycled materials to create amazing 3D art work through
visual arts.</p>

</p>
<p>As part of our schoolâ€™s commitment to eco-stewardship, Blooming Gardens
@ WVPS was officially opened by Mr Edward Chia, Member of Parliament (MP)
for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, on 17 February 2025 to provide a vibrant outdoor
learning space that nurtures studentsâ€™ environmental awareness and appreciation
for nature. This green sanctuary serves as a hands-on environmental learning
hub, where students engage in sustainable urban farming, biodiversity exploration,
and eco-friendly initiative. &nbsp;It marks a new chapter in our journey
towards sustainability and eco-stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme: Sustainability using STEM/STEAM</strong>
</p>
<p>The school embarked on an Overseas Immersion Programme with Tai Po Old
Market Public School (Plover Cove) and Lee Chi Tat Memorial School in Hong
Kong in 2024.</p>
<p>This enriching exchange provided students with first-hand experience of
Hong Kongâ€™s education system, fostering cultural understanding and international
friendships. Our partner schoolsâ€™ focus on sustainability and technology
offered valuable insights, allowing students and teachers to explore innovative
learning approaches while sharing best practices.</p>
<p>Through this programme, our students gained global perspectives, enhancing
their appreciation for different cultures and how technology can be used
to enhance sustainability efforts in school.</p>

<p><strong>The Green Warriors</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Green Warrior</strong> is a student-led initiative aimed at
fostering environmental responsibility among students. Selected students
from each class take on the role of <strong>Green Warrior</strong>, serving
as eco-stewards of sustainability within the school community.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/alp3.png">
</div>
<p>Green Warriors play a pivotal role in ensuring that the school environment
remains clean and green. To encourage teamwork and cooperation in maintaining
a clean and green classroom, eco-stewards plan a class duty roster to ensure
fair distribution of responsibilities among their classmates.</p>
<p>They would monitor the duty completion by their peers and provide reminders
when necessary.</p>
<p>They lead by example by encouraging their peers to adopt green daily habits
such as reducing energy use and food waste, conserving water and recycling.</p>
<p>By empowering students with leadership roles in environmental conservation,
the Green Warriors instills lifelong eco-friendly habits and strengthens
the schoolâ€™s commitment to sustainability. Through their efforts, Green
Warriors help cultivate a cleaner, greener, and more responsible school
community.</p>
<p><strong>DA VINCI Capstone Design Thinking projects (P4 &amp; P5): Design Challenge- Environmental Sustainability Themes</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Capstone Project</strong> provides opportunities for students
to apply <strong>design thinking</strong> as an approach to create and present
meaningful projects. It brings together the skills they have learnt in
the <strong>DA VINCI Programme</strong> and allows students to showcase their
innovative mindset, deepening their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking
skills.</p>
<p>Students will also take part in <strong>cross-cultural exchanges</strong> with
partner schools, joining activities, gaining new insights, and making friends.
This experience helps them learn about different cultures, broaden their
perspectives, and deepen their learning journey.</p>

<p>West View Primary School has been honoured with the distinguished Bronze
Award in the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Innergy Awards for its
pioneering sustainability efforts through the use of Black Soldier Fly
in reducing food waste. This recognition underscores the school's commitment
to innovative and environmentally conscious practices in education.</p>
<p>West View has been at the forefront of sustainable education, with a particular
focus on Black Soldier Fly as a groundbreaking initiative. The school implemented
the Black Soldier Fly programme as part of its commitment to waste reduction
and sustainable agriculture. The larvae of Black Soldier Fly efficiently
convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost and protein-rich insect
biomass.</p>
<p>The black soldier fly farming initiative has played a pivotal role in
waste reduction within the school. Organic waste from the school canteen
and other sources is efficiently processed by the larvae, resulting in
reduced landfill waste and the production of valuable resources.</p>
<p>West View has also seamlessly integrated black soldier fly farming into
the curriculum, offering students interdisciplinary learning opportunities.
Students not only gained practical knowledge in sustainable agriculture
but also developed a profound understanding of the ecological importance
of insects in waste management.</p>
<p>West View is dedicated to expanding its sustainable initiatives. The school
envisions further integration of innovative and environmentally conscious
practices into its curriculum, creating a lasting impact on students and
the community.</p>
