Our Priority
------------

_We are what we repeatedly do._ _Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit._ (Aristotle)  

In West View, we believe in paving the way for our pupils to excel and succeed. Through Start-It-Right Programme, we set the agenda for pupils to focus for the term and week - we set the tone, provide feedback and celebrate efforts. With the clarity of expectations and timely feedback, it becomes more evident that pupils give their best in pursuing excellence along the way.
