<h4>Description of Signature Programme</h4>
<p>As we all know that Einstein had a very challenging childhood. But because
of his perseverance and commitment, he became very successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In West View, we believe that Every West Viewan is a Talented Pupil. Every
child is unique and endowed with different gifts and talents. With our
approach, we endeavour to discover and grow every child and provide platforms
to ignite the joy of learning in our pupils. We aim to nurture and develop
them to be like Einstein; Engaged, Inquistive and Confident learners who
in turn go on to fulfil their personal best.</p>
<p>The fundamental value in our EinSTein Programme is the belief that we
care for our high support learners. We affirm their self-worth and commit
ourselves to giving the best in their personal transformation and improvement.
As we support this group of learners, we set to achieve our belief that
they will be motivated to discover themselves better, in terms of strengths,
interests and passion. With this boost to their self-confidence, we aim
to improve their academic performance, as they relate their talent discovery
success stories to their academics improvement.</p>

and Co<strong>N</strong>fident. Our approach is to&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xplore
individual talents,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>dentify learning needs and&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>urture
the whole child through a&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>tudent-centred and&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>alent-focused
programme so that every child has the opportunity to succeed and achieve
their personal best.</p>

<h2>Academic Support and Intervention Programme</h2>
<p>EinSTein in West View continued to provide additional support to pupils
with weak oral and reading</p>
<p>skills in their English language and their respective Mother Tongue languages
via the following</p>
<p>intervention programmes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>English:&nbsp;<a href="/our-curriculum/english-language/enrichment-programmes-n-support" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LSP, SDR and RRP</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mother Tongues:&nbsp;<a href="/our-curriculum/mother-tongue-languages/enrichment-programmes-n-support" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP)</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These programmes aimed to equip these pupils with basic reading and spelling
skills so that they can</p>
<p>learn in the regular classes.</p>
<p>For pupils with weak numeracy skills, they are supported by&nbsp;<a href="/our-curriculum/mathematics/enrichment-programmes-n-support" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LSM</a>&nbsp;(P1
and P2) and&nbsp;<a href="/our-curriculum/mathematics/enrichment-programmes-n-support" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ICAN</a>&nbsp;(P3
to P6)</p>
<p>programme.</p>
<h2>Experiential Learning</h2>
<p>Through various experiential learning experience, pupils developed social-emotional
skills such as building confidence, resilience, effective communication
and respect. These experiences allow pupils to empathise, persevere in
building relationships and trust and be reflective on their learning. It
also stretches their willingness to dare and try something new and alleviate
their confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating our little Einstein project</strong>
</p>
<p>Our EinSTein pupils attended an art workshop where they had to let their
creative juices flow to create beautiful postcards. Through their artwork,
these pupils aimed to spread the message of inclusion; expressing in&nbsp;~as~&nbsp;words
promoting inclusiveness written in calligraphy on each postcard. The beautiful
backdrop that carries the message was made using alcohol ink. Each postcard
board includes a collaborative effort between two pupils.</p>
<p>As a first step in raising awareness of inclusivity, these postcards will
be printed and distributed within and shared with other schools.</p>
