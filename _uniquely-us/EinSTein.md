In alignment to our school’s motto, “Every West Viewan, a talented pupil”, we believe that every child is unique and endowed with different gifts and talents within them, waiting to be discovered. We endeavour to discover and grow every child and provide platforms to ignite the joy of learning in our pupils and nurture them into confident, motivated and self-directed learners who then go on to fulfil their personal best.

  

The fundamental value in our EinSTein Programme is the belief that we care for our high support learners. We affirm their self-worth and commit ourselves to giving the best in their personal transformation and improvement. As we support this group of learners, we set to achieve our belief that they will be motivated to discover themselves better, in terms of strengths, interests and passion. With this boost to their self-confidence, we aim to improve their academic performance, as they relate their talent discovery success stories to their academics improvement.

  

Through EinSTein Programme, we strive to develop our pupils to be **E**ngaged, **I**nquisitive and Co**N**fident. Our approach is to **E**xplore individual talents, **I**dentify learning needs and **N**urture the whole child through a **S**tudent-centred and **T**alent-focused programme so that every child has the opportunity to succeed and achieve their personal best.
