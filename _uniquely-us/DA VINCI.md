Introduction
------------

The Da Vinci programme in West View Primary School is to nurture critical thinking in our West Viewans. Every child is special, with unique combinations of talents and abilities. All of them deserve the opportunity to learn in ways that make the most of their strengths. So, in Da Vinci, we recognise these differences and provide pupils with varied opportunities to maximise their potential to the fullest.

Science for High Progress Learners
----------------------------------

*   **[Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science](http://moe.gov.sg/programmes/high-ability-learners)**

  

Supported by the Gifted Education Branch, E2K Science is run by teachers in schools who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy. The programme engages upper primary pupils in scientific investigations involving advanced science concepts. It aims to engage pupils in scientific inquiry that will help them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
