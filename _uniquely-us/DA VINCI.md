Philosophy
------------

The Da Vinci programme in West View Primary School is to nurture critical thinking in our West Viewans. Every child is special, with unique combinations of talents and abilities. All of them deserve the opportunity to learn in ways that make the most of their strengths. So, in Da Vinci, we recognise these differences and provide pupils with varied opportunities to maximise their potential to the fullest.

<h2 style="color:midnightblue">Da Vinci Programme</h2>
Our DA VINCI Programme focus on providing opportunities to stretch high ability learners. These include E2K Math, E2K Science, Culture Inculcation (MT), Internationalisation etc; which offer high level problems and projects that allow students to work independently and think creatively. Selected students also have the opportunity to participate in various competitions to foster a love of learning and explore their interests.
