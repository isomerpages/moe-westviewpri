<p><strong>Aesthetics Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Aesthetics Week was an explosion of creativity! From mesmerising online
beatboxing, karaoke with classmates to vibrant sidewalk chalk drawings;
every moment was a masterpiece. The immersive music experience transported
the pupils to another dimension, while tote bag-colouring added a personal
touch to the swag, but the highlight was the stunning Wearable Art Parade!</p>

<p>For the Wearable Art Parade, pupils used recyclable materials to design
and create their own fashion pieces. They made something valuable for themselves
and others.</p>
<p>Arts is definitely an expression of one’s creativity! Pupils displayed
their creative talents and drew on the courtyard floor using colourful
chalks. What a wonderful experience indeed!</p>
