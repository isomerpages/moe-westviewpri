Malay Language Seminar
----------------------

Our Malay Language Teachers has successfully presented two classroom-based research papers at **MALAY LANGUAGE SEMINAR 2020** on **Tuesday, 17 March 2020**.

  

The Malay Language Seminar is organised annually by the Malay Language Centre of Singapore (MLCS), Ministry of Education. It is recognised as an effective platform for teachers to share and learn together in improving teaching and learning (T&L) of Malay Language (ML) in schools. This year, only 16 classroom-based research papers were shared at the concurrent sessions.

  

The theme of the seminar for 2020 was ‘**Harnessing Technology, Enhancing Learning**’ (_Memanfaatkan Teknologi, Meningkatkan Pembelajaran_).

  

All papers were printed in a seminar proceeding book, and distributed to all participants. In-lieu of Covid-19 precautionary measures, all participants were asked to report to the classrooms directly and live-stream webinar was used during the keynote speaker session.

  

Our teachers shared an effective pedagogy and research paper that infuse ICT in the T&L of ML at the concurrent session. The titles of our sharing are as follow :

  

*      **Use of Learning Stations and SLS in Picture Composition Writing** (_Penggunaan Stesen Pembelajaran & SLS dalam Kemahiran Menulis Karangan Bergambar_)
