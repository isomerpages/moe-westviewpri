Sharing at the World Tamil Conference
-------------------------------------

We are pleased to share that our Tamil Language Teacher, Mdm Nisha was invited to share at the World Tamil Conference on 7 September. She was sharing on the Kolb’s Learning Cycle in SPACE and the perspective-taking strategies. This sharing is made possible because our TL teachers have been thinking hard and working collaboratively to engage our TL learners to love the language and become more competent users.
