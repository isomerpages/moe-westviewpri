<p>Education Minister Ong Ye Kung mandated, “Lift the bottom, not cap the
top”. In West View, we ensure that we have programmes to stretch the high
progress learners and to support the struggling learners.</p>
<h5><strong>Literacy Support Programmes</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Through specialised early intervention programmes, learning support is
provided for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils who need targeted help with
the English Language. These pupils are selected through careful screening.
The programme focuses on building English language skills that pupils used
to decode and be more confident users of the language.</p>
<p>LSP is conducted half an hour a day (in small groups of 8 to 10 pupils).</p>

in reading. Pupils are exposed to a range of coping strategies for reading
comprehension which will enable them to better manage their learning in
the regular classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Programme: DA VINCI - B.R.A.I.N. PROGRAMME</strong>

and express their ideas coherently and use these skills to produce texts
for a variety of purposes, audiences, and contexts.</p>
<p>Primary 4 pupils will learn to speak clearly and convey their ideas expressively.
They will also improve their skills in articulation and vocal projection.
