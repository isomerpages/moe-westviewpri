**LSM and ICAN Programmes**  

  

P1 and P2 high-support learners are supported by the Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme while P3 to P6 high-support learners are supported by Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) programme. These programmes aim to provide assistance to pupils who are weak in Mathematics. They help to build their foundational numeracy skills and knowledge through activity-based lessons, focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.

**Financial Literacy Programme**

Financial Literacy provides the opportunity for pupils to acquire basic financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting and investing so as to develop positive habits and attitudes relating to money.



Our Financial Literacy programme will provide our pupils the relevant hands-on experience in relation to the real world applications. Through gamified lessons and experiential learning, our pupils will be highly engaged and improve their financial literacy knowledge and its application in real life
