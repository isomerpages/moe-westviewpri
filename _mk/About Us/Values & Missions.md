<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do
so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to
Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate
strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our curriculum is designed by MOE's curriculum specialists, and is based
on the Nurturing Early Learners Framework which guides the development
of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a well-designed physical environment and through our two flagship
programmes - the HI-Light programme and the Starlight Literacy programme,
your child will engage in authentic learning experiences.</p>
