<h2>Message from Centre Head/ MK</h2>
<p>
<br><strong>Ms Shereen Low</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"At MK@West View, we see the importance to provide authentic and purposeful play and learning experiences as it allows children to take charge of their own learning. With the use of our local context, children are able to immerse in what they see, hear and experience on a day-to-day basis and relate it to what they have learned.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Partnership with families and the community is a crucial factor in building a positive school experience for our young children too.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>On the other hand, taking care and providing support to the MK educators who are delivering the curriculum and taking care of our young children is equally necessary. With a purpose in mind and understanding their roles and responsibilities, we are confident that MK educators will be providing a strong start for all children."</em>
