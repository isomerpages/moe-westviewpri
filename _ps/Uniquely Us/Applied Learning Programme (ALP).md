<h1>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): FRIEND of Earth</h1>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides the opportunity for pupils
to appreciate the relevance and usefulness of what they learn in the classrooms
for the application to the real world.</p>
<p>In West View Primary School,&nbsp;<em>ALP: FRIEND of Earth</em>, provides
our pupils with opportunities to investigate and explore in Science, Technology,
Reading, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STREAM) curriculum. Through
inquiry-based and experiential learning, pupils build on what they learn
about environmental education in the classroom and connect the learning
to situations that are happening around the world</p>
<p>It is envisioned that Every West Viewan is a&nbsp;<strong><em>FRIEND of Earth</em></strong>,
whose role as a :</p>

<h5><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></h5>
<p><strong>3R Initiatives</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond just knowing the facts (head) about Reducing, Reusing and Recycling
and on how to save the environment during Science, Reading and Art programmes,
pupils learn to cherish the miracle in Mother Nature, appreciate the enduring
understanding of how Man impacts the environment and be grateful how Mother
Nature provides for and affects us (hearts). Through their actions (hands),
pupils play the roles as Facilitators and Diplomats to develop pro-social
behaviours and educate others the cause of their actions, such as reducing
food waste, food recycling, saving water and electricity as well as vermicomposting.
They also use recycled materials to create amazing 3D art work through
visual arts.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability Efforts @ WVPS: Black Soldier Fly (BSF) Upcycling Project</strong>

<p>As part of the school’s initiative towards promoting sustainability, the
Environment Corp Prefects, from Primary Four to Primary Six, embarked on
an exciting journey with the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae.</p>
<p>With the guidance of teachers from the ALP team, the prefects had hands-on
experience in taking care and maintaining the BSF larvae.&nbsp; The BSF
larvae were fed with food waste collected from the school canteen daily.
It is heartening to see the prefects showing such enthusiasm and dare (to
touch the larvae) in caring for the BSF.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>During the weekly clean-up, the prefects had to remove all the uneaten
food left in the bin. We are heartened to see the “twinkle” in their eyes
as they sieve for frass. The frass collected was used as a fertilizer for
the plants in the school. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this project, the prefects not only get to witness the life cycle
of the BSF and learn about the impact these flies have on food waste management,
but they also got to play a part in the whole cycle of reducing and converting
food waste into useful fertilizer (frass) for the plants.&nbsp; They act
as advocates through their act of influencing sound sustainability practices
amongst their peers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that the hands-on experience would spur the pupils to keep up
their efforts in creating a sustainable environment and be aware that they
can make a difference, as Eco-stewards of the environment!</p>

<p>The School Green Award, launched by the Singapore Environment Council,&nbsp;
is a prestigious recognition that celebrates and acknowledges outstanding
achievements in environmental sustainability and green initiatives within
educational institutions. This award aims to encourage schools to adopt
and promote eco-friendly practices, fostering a culture of environmental
responsibility among students, staff, and the broader school community.</p>
<p>In recognition of our outstanding efforts and community outreach in fostering
environmental sustainability, the school was awarded the Yellow Flame award.
This award celebrates the school's commitment to creating a positive impact
on the environment and engaging the community in sustainable practices
through the partnership with various stakeholders, including North West
Community Development Council, National Parks Board and Zhenghua Grassroots.
Our signature programme, the Black Soldier Fly, has also been lauded by
residents and other educational institutions in its use to reduce food
waste.</p>
<p>West View’s sustainability initiatives have already made a substantial
impact, not only within school but also in inspiring positive change in
the community. Looking forward, the school remains committed to expanding
its sustainability efforts and fostering even greater community engagement.</p>

<p>West View Primary School has been honoured with the distinguished Bronze
Award in the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Innergy Awards for its
pioneering sustainability efforts through the use of Black Soldier Fly
in reducing food waste. This recognition underscores the school's commitment
to innovative and environmentally conscious practices in education.</p>
<p>West View has been at the forefront of sustainable education, with a particular
focus on Black Soldier Fly as a groundbreaking initiative. The school implemented
the Black Soldier Fly programme as part of its commitment to waste reduction
and sustainable agriculture. The larvae of Black Soldier Fly efficiently
convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost and protein-rich insect
biomass.</p>
<p>The black soldier fly farming initiative has played a pivotal role in
waste reduction within the school. Organic waste from the school canteen
and other sources is efficiently processed by the larvae, resulting in
reduced landfill waste and the production of valuable resources.</p>
<p>West View has also seamlessly integrated black soldier fly farming into
the curriculum, offering students interdisciplinary learning opportunities.
Students not only gained practical knowledge in sustainable agriculture
but also developed a profound understanding of the ecological importance
of insects in waste management.</p>
<p>West View is dedicated to expanding its sustainable initiatives. The school
envisions further integration of innovative and environmentally conscious
practices into its curriculum, creating a lasting impact on students and
the community.</p>
