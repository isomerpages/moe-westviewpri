<p>West View Primary School Partners in Action (PiA) plays a key role in
fostering a strong partnership between parents and the school. It is also
a platform for all parents who would like to contribute and participate
actively in their children’s development. Through participating in the
school programmes at WVPS, parents have a better understanding of how the
school conducts their programmes and activities to provide a holistic education
for the pupils. PiA also strives to enhance and enrich the experience for
every West Viewan.</p>
<p>PiA members assist in school events, organize programmes and events to
engage pupils, accompany students for learning journeys and roster duties
around school such as recess and library duties to name a few. Our members
play a crucial role in showing the importance of school experience by being
part of the school; putting in time and effort into their learning.&nbsp;</p>
