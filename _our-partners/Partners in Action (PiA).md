West View Primary School Partners in Action (PiA) plays a key role in fostering a strong partnership between parents and the school. It is also a platform for all parents who would like to contribute and participate actively in their children’s development. Through participating in the school programmes at WVPS, parents have a better understanding of how the school conducts their programmes and activities to provide a holistic education for the pupils. PiA also strives to enhance and enrich the experience for every West Viewan.

PiA members assist in school events, organize programmes and events to engage pupils, accompany students for learning journeys and roster duties around school such as recess and library duties to name a few. Our members play a crucial role in showing the importance of school experience by being part of the school; putting in time and effort into their learning.&nbsp;
