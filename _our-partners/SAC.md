School Advisory Committee (SAC)
-------------------------------

It takes a village to raise a child. In West View Primary School (WVPS), we recognise that educating children today is a daunting undertaking. We cannot do this alone; hence we partner parents and the community to provide the best educational experience for our pupils. We are indeed blessed to have wonderful support and strong partnership with our School Advisory Committee (SAC). SAC has been actively involved in all aspects of our school programmes, and are dedicated supporters both in deed and time in our endeavour to provide a holistic education for our pupils.
