<p>To support our vision “A Strong Start for Every Child”, G.R.O.W.ing U.P.
is designed to promote holistic development of our children with a focus
on inculcating values and developing social and emotional competencies
in them. As the early years is a critical period of children’s growth and
development, it also aims to create their awareness in healthy eating and
keeping physically active that will help them develop habits to embrace
an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>A series of learning experiences is planned to be carried out for a week
in a term with a different focus for each day, such as healthy eating and
regular exercise; respecting and showing kindness to our friends; and building
relationships with friends and adults through positive and purposeful interactions.</p>
