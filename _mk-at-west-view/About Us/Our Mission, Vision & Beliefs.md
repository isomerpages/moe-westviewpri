<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten (MK), we believe that children are curious, active
and competent learners.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Children are curious learners</strong>
<br>They have an innate sense of curiosity that should be nurtured. They wonder,
question, explore and seek to make sense and meaning of their world. By
acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover and learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Children are active learners</strong>&nbsp;
<br>They learn by doing. They are also more likely to understand and remember
skills and concepts learnt through participation, exploration and experimentation
involving real-life objects and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Children are competent learners</strong> 
<br>Their thinking and reasoning skills evolve over time as they build new
knowledge upon their existing knowledge and experiences. Through constantly
thinking and reflecting about their learning, children deepen their understanding
of how the world works.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do
so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to
Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate
strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our curriculum is designed by MOE's curriculum specialists, and is based
on the Nurturing Early Learners Framework which guides the development
of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a well-designed physical environment and through our two flagship
programmes - the HI-Light programme and the Starlight Literacy programme,
your child will engage in authentic learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
