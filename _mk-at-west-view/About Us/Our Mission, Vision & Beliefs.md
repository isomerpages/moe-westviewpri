Our Beliefs
-----------

At MOE Kindergarten (MK), we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners.  
  

*   **Children are curious learners**<br>They have an innate sense of curiosity that should be nurtured. They wonder, question, explore and seek to make sense and meaning of their world. By acting on their curiosity, they continue to discover and learn more.  
      
    

*   **Children are active learners** <br>They learn by doing. They are also more likely to understand and remember skills and concepts learnt through participation, exploration and experimentation involving real-life objects and experiences.   
      
    

*   **Children are competent learners** <br>Their thinking and reasoning skills evolve over time as they build new knowledge upon their existing knowledge and experiences. Through constantly thinking and reflecting about their learning, children deepen their understanding of how the world works. 

Our Vision
----------

*   Our vision is to provide a strong start for every child. We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector. 

*   We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.

*   Our curriculum is designed by MOE's curriculum specialists, and is based on the Nurturing Early Learners Framework which guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore. 

*   With a well-designed physical environment and through our two flagship programmes - the HI-Light programme and the Starlight Literacy programme, your child will engage in authentic learning experiences.

**Message from Centre Head/ MK** <br>
**Ms Shereen Low**  

_"At MK@West View, we see the importance to provide authentic and purposeful play and learning experiences as it allows children to take charge of their own learning. With the use of our local context, children are able to immerse in what they see, hear and experience on a day-to-day basis and relate it to what they have learned._

_Partnership with families and the community is a crucial factor in building a positive school experience for our young children too._ 

_On the other hand, taking care and providing support to the MK educators who are delivering the curriculum and taking care of our young children is equally necessary. With a purpose in mind and understanding their roles and responsibilities, we are confident that MK educators will be providing a strong start for all children."_
