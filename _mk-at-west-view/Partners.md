Kindergarten Care
-----------------
We offer Kindergarten Care (KCare), a care service from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. including school holidays. It is closed on public holidays and up to 6 additional days each year.

If you register, your child can be in KCare before and after their MK session, providing the convenience of a full-day service within the same premises.

  

Early Years Centre (EYC)
------------------------

We partner with PCF Sparkletots in an MK - Early Years centre (EYC) pilot model.  
This partnership guarantees a Kindergarten 1 placementÂ  (when your child turns five years old) in our MK.
